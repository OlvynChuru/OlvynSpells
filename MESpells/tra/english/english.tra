Saving Throw: None  

This spell changes the coloration of the caster to match the surrounding environment, making <PRO_HIMHER> very difficult to see.

This bonus increases by +5% at 2nd level, and +5% per 2 levels after that, to a maximum of +75% at 10th level.

(Divination)

Level: 1
Sphere: Animal
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 Turn
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster

When the caster completes this spell and touches an allied animal, <PRO_HESHE> gains the ability to see through that animal's eyes allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to see everything that that animal sees.  Additionally, <PRO_HESHE> has greater influence over the creature, urging it to be more aggressive in its attacks, granting it a +1 critical threat rolls.

While this spell is in effect, the caster's body is helpless, as <PRO_HESHE> is helpless, and blind.
-----------------------
Beast Sense
(Divination)

Level: 2
Sphere: Animal, Divination
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The Beast Sense spell allows the druid to see through the eyes of an animal and sense what it senses. For the duration of the spell or until dispelled, the party can see any creature or object that the animal can see. Beast Sense does not by itself allow the druid to control the animal, though it could be cast on a charmed animal for use as a scout. The spell has no effect on a creature that isn't an animal.

Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The spell Extend Vision allows the recipient to see much farther than <PRO_HESHE> could see before. The recipient will be able to see creatures that are too far away to return the gaze.

It lasts for 8 hours or until dispelled.

Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the caster causes all friendly animals within range to become tougher, stronger and more tenacious.

Animal Growth greatly increases the size of allied animals in the area of effect, making them twice as large in each dimension. Animals enlarged this way have their hit points doubled, and they gain +4 THAC0 and deal double damage. They also move faster (since they cover twice as much distance with each step). Both living and undead animals (including spirit animals) can be affected by this spell, but shapeshifted druids cannot.

Also the target's Strength is set to 25 for the duration of the spell and receives all the bonuses to hit and damage rolls that this Strength confers.

The drawback to this is that the priest must concentrate on the connection between the target and <PRO_HISHER> god for the duration of the spell, hence losing the ability to cast any spells during this time. The effect lasts for 3 rounds for every level of the caster or until dispelled.~

Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Snake's Swiftness allows a single creature to move and attack extremely fast for a single round. During the round, the creature's movement rate and attacks per round are doubled. In addition, if the target is an animal, a lycanthrope, a yuan-ti, or a character shapeshifted into one such creature, it is sped up further, gaining 2 additional attacks per round and moving at the maximum possible movement rate for the duration.~
@32152=~Hex
(Enchantment)

Level: 1
Sphere: Numbers
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell curses the target to take more magical and elemental damage. The target must make a Save vs. Polymorph. On a failure, the target is cursed for 6 rounds. During that time, whenever the target would be dealt fire, cold, electricity, acid, or magic damage, it takes an additional 6 damage of that type. Hex is especially effective when combined with spells that deal damage multiple times, such as Writhing Fog.~
@32153=~Hunter's Mark

Sphere: Divination
Range: 10000 ft.
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 1

By casting Hunter's Mark, the ranger magically marks a non-allied creature to be hunted. For the duration, the ranger's attacks against the marked target deal an additional 1d6 damage, plus another 1d6 for every 10 levels of the ranger. In addition, when the target is out of sight, the spell greatly enhances the ranger's ability to track the target, sufficient for the ranger to know the target's exact location and direction. Hunter's Mark can be cast on any creature the party sees, even if the ranger does not see them.~

(Enchantment)

Level: 1
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 3

Level: 1
Sphere: Guardian
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: Instant
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius

(Divination)

Level: 2
Sphere: Animal, Divination
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The Beast Sense spell allows the druid to see through the eyes of an animal and sense what it senses. For the duration of the spell or until dispelled, the party can see any creature or object that the animal can see. Beast Sense does not by itself allow the druid to control the animal, though it could be cast on a charmed animal for use as a scout. The spell has no effect on a creature that isn't an animal.~
@32252=~Fiery Link
(Evocation)

Level: 2
Sphere: Elemental Fire
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: All creatures in a narrow line between the caster and an ally
Saving Throw: 1/2

In casting Fiery Link, the caster must choose an allied creature other than <PRO_HIMHER>self. This spell creates a ray of fire linking the caster and that ally, damaging any creatures in between. If the caster and/or the ally move, the fiery link will stretch and contract to fill the distance between them. Every three seconds, any creature that crosses the fiery link (not including the caster or the ally) takes 1d8 fire damage (Save vs. Breath for half). A single caster can cast Fiery Link on multiple allies, but a single ally cannot be targeted by more than one Fiery Link at once.~
@32253=~Null Healing
(Necromancy)

Level: 2
Sphere: Healing
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 day
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This necromantic curse prevents the target from healing. Once cast, the target must save vs. Spell at -8 or be cursed for 1 day. While cursed, the target cannot regain Hit Points via spells, abilities, items, regeneration, or resting. The curse can be removed early using a Remove Curse spell.~
@32254=~Critical Boon
(Alteration)

Level: 2
Sphere: Combat
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 3 rounds or until a critical hit
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Critical Boon empowers an ally, allowing them to get a guaranteed critical hit on their next attack. If the target attacks a creature that is immune to critical hits, the spell won't trigger, saving the effect for when the target attacks a creature that isn't immune.~
@32255=~Ghostwalk
(Alteration)

Level: 2
Sphere: Travelers
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell makes multiple allies partially ethereal for 1 round. While partially ethereal, creatures are immune to normal weapons and can move through walls. Ghostwalk could be used to move the party through a wall, eluding enemies. When the spell ends, if a character is inside a wall, they will be pushed to the nearest inhabitable space.~
@32256=~Detect Magic
(Divination)

Level: 2
Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Detect Magic lets the party see the magical effects on other creatures. While the spell is active, if you hover the cursor over a creature and press Left Shift, a list of all the spell effects on the creature (such as Stoneskin or Protection from Magical Weapons) will be displayed. If the creature has Non-Detection, nothing will be displayed.~
@32351=~Call Water Weirds
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 3
Sphere: Summoning, Elemental Water
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Entire area
Saving Throw: None

This spell temporarily calls water weirds into existence in bodies of water in the current area. These water weirds will fight on the side of whoever cast this spell most recently - if an enemy casts this spell, the water weirds will be hostile, but will switch to the party's side if a party member then casts this spell as well. Unlike other summoning spells, this spell does not summon creatures directly to the caster's side; instead, it spawns water weirds in specific bodies of water in the current area. If the current area does not have any bodies of water large enough for a water weird, the spell does nothing.~
@32352=~Shortening
(Alteration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Numbers
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Shortening halves the duration of certain effects on the target creature. If the target is an enemy, then all non-harmful effects on the target will have their duration halved. If the target is not an enemy, then all harmful effects on the target will have their duration halved. A "harmful effect" is any effect from a spell or ability that turns a non-hostile creature hostile. The duration is halved from the total duration of the effect, not the remaining duration. An effect can only be shortened once.~
@32353=~Fire Curse
(Alteration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Elemental Fire
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell can only be cast on enemies. For the duration, all damage dealt to the target is converted to fire damage, regardless of the original damage type. The creature will be dealt damage based on its fire resistance, not its resistance to the original damage type. Physical damage converted to fire damage will bypass Stoneskin. There is no saving throw, though magic resistance can still block the spell.~
@32354=~Healing Curse
(Alteration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Healing
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

Healing Curse causes a creature's attacks to heal rather than harm. If the recipient is an ally, there is no Saving Throw necessary; otherwise, the recipient may make a Save vs. Polymorph at -2 to avoid the effects. While affected by Healing Curse, any damage the creature would deal through attacks, spells or abilities is negated, and the creature that would have been damaged is instead healed by the amount of damage they would have taken.~
@32355=~Guardian Magic
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Guardian
Range: 15 ft.
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell grants magical protection to any creature the paladin guards with the Guard action. For the duration, as long as the paladin is guarding another creature within 15 feet, that creature gains a +6 Armor Class bonus and +30% Magic Resistance.~

(Alteration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Elemental Air
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special

(Alteration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Travelers
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This wondrous spell gives a creature the power to fly. For the duration, the creature can fly over normally impassable objects such as houses, walls, and rivers, but only as long as the creature is outdoors. The higher level the caster, the faster the creature's flying speed. The creature is also unaffected by ground-based spells such as Grease, Web, Entangle, and Earthquake.~
@32358=~Familiar Spell
(Conjuration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Combat, Summoning
Range: Familiar must be in the same area
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: The caster's familiar
Saving Throw: None

Familiar Spell imbues the Beastmaster's familiar with a spell. The caster chooses one of their 1st-level spells, consuming one use of that spell. For the next 8 hours, each time their familiar hits a creature with an attack, it instantly casts a copy of the chosen spell on the target. The spell is cast at the level of the familiar's owner, not at the level of the familiar. The familiar must be owned by the caster, and it must be in the same area as the caster when Familiar Spell is cast (and not in the caster's inventory).~
@32360=~Recall Party
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 3
Sphere: Summoning
Range: Infinite
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: All party members
Saving Throw: None

Recall Party teleports all party members to the caster's side. The range is unlimited, and party members can be drawn from a different area, so long as they are on the same plane as the caster.~
@32361=~Steel Wind Strike
(Alteration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Combat
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

After casting Steel Wind Strike, the caster is enabled to zoom between each enemy in the area of effect, making attacks against each enemy with each equipped weapon. The caster must have one or more melee weapons equipped for this spell to function; ranged weapons won't work. Attacks made this way can critically hit and will apply any on-hit effects of the weapons.~
@32451=~Disarm
(Enchantment)

Level: 4
Sphere: Combat
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 8 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

The spell Disarm causes creatures' weapons to disappear. Each enemy in the area of effect must make a Save vs. Wands at -2. On a failure, that creature's weapon vanishes temporarily, and the creature is forced to fight with its fists. For the duration, the creature cannot equip another weapon - if it does so, that weapon vanishes as well. The creature's weapons reappear if it dies before the duration expires. Disarm has no effect if the target is using a natural weapon or does not have a weapon in any of its quickslots.~
@32452=~Forest's Blessing
(Conjuration)

Level: 4
Sphere: Plant
Range: 0
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster calls the forest <PRO_HESHE> is currently in for aid in casting spells. For the duration, the caster casts spells as if 10 levels higher. Forest's Blessing has no effect if not cast outside in a forest.~
@32453=~Turn Creature
(Abjuration)

Level: 4
Sphere: Guardian
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

Turn Creature allows the priest to turn a non-undead creature. Once the spell is cast, the target creature must Save vs. Polymorph at -4. On a failure, the creature is turned as if it was an undead creature affected by the priest's Turn Undead ability. Depending on the level of the target, the level of the priest, the alignment of the priest, and random chance, the target may either be forced to run away from the priest temporarily, controlled by the priest temporarily, or killed instantly.~
@32454=~Wall of Fire
(Evocation)

Level: 4
Sphere: Elemental Fire
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 8 ft. long, 2 ft. wide wall
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a wall of raging flames. Any creature who attempts to pass through the wall takes 1d4 fire damage per caster level, up to a maximum of 12d4 at level 12. There is no Saving Throw, since the flames cannot be dodged except by going around the wall. A creature that has passed through a Wall of Fire cannot take damage from passing through a Wall of Fire again for 1 round.~
@32455=~Piercing Shots
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Sphere: Combat
Range: Special
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the ranger's missile attacks to pierce through creatures. For the duration, any arrow, bolt, bullet, dart, dagger, or axe launched or thrown by the ranger will pierce through creatures in a line, dealing the attack's damage (as well as any on-hit effects) to each creature.~
@32456=~Pebbles to Boulders
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Sphere: Elemental Earth
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell turns the caster's sling bullets into boulders. While the spell is active, if the caster launches a bullet, it instantly turns into a large boulder that retains the speed of the original bullet. The boulder inflicts an additional 3d6+8 damage if it hits (on top of the former damage of the bullet). Pebbles to Boulders also synergizes with the Magic Stone spell, letting one launch a Magic Boulder. Only a limited number of bullets or Magic Stones can be turned into boulders before the spell ends: up to one per 3 levels.~
@32551=~Prolongment
(Alteration)

Level: 5
Sphere: Numbers
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Prolongment doubles the duration of certain effects on the target creature. If the target is an enemy, then all harmful effects on the target will have their duration doubled. If the target is not an enemy, then all non-harmful effects on the target will have their duration doubled. A "harmful effect" is any effect from a spell or ability that turns a non-hostile creature hostile. The duration is doubled from the total duration of the effect, not the remaining duration. An effect can only be prolonged once.~
@32552=~Wall of Force
(Abjuration)

Level: 5
Sphere: Guardian
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 8 ft. long, 2 ft. wide wall
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a wall of magical force, which stays for 5 rounds. Creatures cannot pass through the wall, though they can still fly over it, teleport past it, or float past it while ethereal. The wall cannot be dispelled.~
@32554=~Ethereal Jaunt
(Alteration)

Level: 5
Sphere: Travelers
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell turns the caster partially ethereal for a short period of time. While partially ethereal, the caster is immune to non-magical weapons, but is still tangible enough to be able to attack and cast spells. The caster can also move through walls while partially ethereal (unlike the Fly spell, this also works indoors). Simply click on a point to move to, and the caster will float to that point, bypassing normally impassable obstacles in the way.~
@32555=~Critical Spell
(Enchantment)

Level: 5
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Duration: 2 hours
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Critical Spell lets the caster repeatedly cast a spell through critical hits. The caster is prompted to store a single 1st-level spell, and the caster's weapons are temporarily imbued with that spell. For the duration, whenever the caster gets a critical hit on a creature, <PRO_HESHE> instantly casts a copy of the stored spell. This will not happen if the critical hit is averted. The caster can also store a 2nd-level spell if they are level 20 or higher, and an additional spell level higher for every ten levels after 20.~
@32556=~Barrage
(Alteration)

Level: 5
Sphere: Combat
Range: Special
Duration: 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell turns the ranger's missile attacks into cone area of effect attacks. For the duration, whenever the ranger attacks with an arrow, bolt, bullet, dart, throwing dagger, or throwing axe, a barrage of copies of the projectile will be launched, dealing the attack's damage (as well as any on-hit effects) to all creatures in a 30-foot cone. Barrage does not work well with missiles that already have an area of effect (like Arrows of Detonation): the missile's normal area of effect will simply be replaced with the cone.~
@32557=~Expose to the Elements
(Alteration)

Level: 5
Sphere: Protection
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The reverse of Protection from the Elements, this spell increases the harm that extreme conditions do to the target's body. It lowers the creature's resistance to fire, magic fire, cold, magic cold and electricity damage by 75%. There is no Saving Throw, but Magic Resistance can still prevent the effects.~
@32558=~Sphere of Security
(Abjuration)

Level: 5
Sphere: Protection
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell surrounds the caster in a large protective sphere. The sphere grants a +2 bonus to AC and saving throws to all allies within its area of effect. In addition, those allies gain the benefits of a single protection scroll, chosen from the following list while the spell is cast:

- Protection from Fire: +50% Fire Resistance
- Protection from Cold: +50% Cold Resistance
- Protection from Electricity: +50% Electricity Resistance
- Protection from Acid: +50% Acid Resistance
- Protection from Poison: Immunity to poison
- Protection from Petrification: Immunity to petrification

A single caster can't emit more than one Sphere of Security at once. However, if multiple casters cast different Spheres of Security, creatures in the spheres will benefit from the protection scroll effects of each sphere (though the AC and saving throw bonuses will not stack).~
@32652=~Drown
(Alteration)

Level: 6
Sphere: Elemental Water
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell effectively causes a creature to drown, whether or not that creature is currently underwater. When cast, the target must Save vs. Breath at -2. On a failure, the target's lungs become filled with water, and the target immediately takes nonlethal damage equal to 90% of its maximum hit points, knocking it unconscious if it would be reduced to 1 Hit Point. For 5 rounds, the target also suffers -4 AC, -4 THAC0, -6 Dexterity, and -1 attack per round. Drown has no effect on undead, constructs, elementals, or other creatures that don't breathe.~
@32653=~Antiharm Shell
(Abjuration)

Level: 6
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell functions like an antimagic shell, except it blocks damage instead of magic. For the duration, the recipient is immune to damage but cannot deal any damage. The recipient can still move, attack, and cast spells, but any damage those attacks or spells would deal is prevented.~
@32654=~Living Lightning
(Evocation)

Level: 6
Sphere: Elemental Air
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

Living Lightning surrounds the caster in a aura of lightning that periodically shoots lightning bolts at enemies. Each round for the duration, the caster automatically releases a lightning bolt at a random enemy within 15 feet. Creatures in the bolt's path take 1d6 damage per 2 caster levels, with a Save vs. Spell for half.~
@32655=~Linked Spirit
(Necromancy)

Level: 6
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Linked Spirit creates a spirit resembling the target creature. The spirit is linked to the target such that almost any spell or effect, including damage from weapons, that would be applied to the spirit is also applied to the target. The spirit itself is harmless.~
@32656=~Protection From Non-Silver Weapons
(Abjuration)

Level: 6
Sphere: Protection, Sun
Range: 0
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None 

When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to all non-silver weapons. Due to the nature of this spell, with the short casting time and duration, it is mainly used to buy the Shapeshifter a few rounds in the thick of combat.~
@32657=~Trial By Fire
(Evocation)

Level: 6
Sphere: Sun
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 8 ft. long, 2 ft. wide wall
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a wall of holy fire, which does not burn the innocent. Any non-good creature that passes through the wall takes 15d4 magic fire damage with no Saving Throw. Good creatures can pass through the wall unharmed.~
@32659=~Greater Steel Wind Strike
(Alteration)

Level: 6
Sphere: Combat
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Like Steel Wind Strike, this spell lets the caster zoom between each enemy in the area of effect, making attacks against each enemy with each equipped weapon. Greater Steel Wind Strike lets the caster make a number of attacks against each creature equal to their attacks per round. The caster must have one or more melee weapons equipped for this spell to function; ranged weapons won't work. Attacks made this way can critically hit and will apply any on-hit effects of the weapons.

A ranger must be at least level 30 to learn this spell.~
@32660=~Animal Growth
(Alteration)

Level: 6
Sphere: Animal
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Animal Growth greatly increases the size of allied animals in the area of effect, making them twice as large in each dimension. Animals enlarged this way have their hit points doubled, and they gain +4 THAC0 and deal double damage. They also move faster (since they cover twice as much distance with each step). Both living and undead animals (including spirit animals) can be affected by this spell, but shapeshifted druids cannot.~
@32661=~Absolute Guard
(Abjuration)

Level: 6
Sphere: Guardian
Range: 15 ft.
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Like the 3rd-level spell Guardian Magic, this spell shields creatures the paladin guards with the Guard action. For the duration, as long as the paladin is guarding another creature within 15 feet, that creature is immune to weapons of +5 enchantment or weaker.~
@32751=~Power Word, Heal
(Necromancy)
	
Level: 7
Sphere: Healing
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When the Power Word of Healing is uttered, one creature of the caster's choice is instantly healed, regaining all Hit Points. The caster can cast Power Word, Heal on a creature even if <PRO_HESHE> cannot see the creature; however, the caster must be aware of the creature's existence and they must be on the same plane.~
@32753=~Nonrandom Zone
(Conjuration)

Level: 7
Sphere: Law
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Entire area
Saving Throw: None

This spell drains the randomness out of the current area. For the duration, all creatures automatically hit, never critically miss, deal maximum physical damage with weapons, take minimum damage from spells, succeed on all Saving Throws automatically, and do not trigger wild surges. Nonrandom Zone can only be cast by lawful characters.~
@32754=~Colossal Growth
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: Quest
Sphere: Plant
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 60-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell causes enormous vines to burst forth from the ground throughout the area of effect. Enemies within 60 feet of the caster must Save vs. Paralysis at -6 each round or be immobilized, completely entangled by giant vines. Even large creatures such as giants and dragons can be entangled this way.~
@32755=~Enhance Attribute
(Alteration)

Level: 7
Sphere: Combat, Thought
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 4 hours
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

An Enhance Attribute spell can vastly improve a single attribute of a creature. In casting this spell, the caster first chooses whether <PRO_HESHE> wishes to enhance a creature's Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. Then <PRO_HESHE> points at a creature, or chooses <PRO_HIMHER>self. The spell sets the chosen attribute of the target creature to 24 for the duration, or until dispelled. The spell has no effect if the chosen attribute of the creature is already higher than 24.~
@32756=~Contingent Resurrection
(Necromancy)

Level: Quest
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent until triggered
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 

This spell stores a Resurrection spell in the target, to be released when the creature dies. The slain creature is automatically brought back to life and immediately restored to full health. Contingent Resurrection then ends, and cannot be applied to the same creature again for 7 days.~
@32757=~Reanimate
(Necromancy)

Level: 7
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Nearest corpse in 3-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell "resurrects" the target as an undead creature under the caster's control. Reanimate cannot target a dead creature directly; it should be cast targeting the location of a corpse. The nearest dead creature to the target point, excluding undead, constructs, most extraplanar creatures, and creatures higher level than the caster, will be reanimated. The reanimated creature becomes undead, but can still use its abilities and spells. It is controlled by the caster until destroyed. Reanimate cannot be cast by good characters.~
@32758=~Mass Heal
(Necromancy)

Level: Quest
Sphere: Healing
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 15
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Mass Heal applies the effects of Heal to all allies in the area of effect. Creatures affected regain all hit points, and are cured of disease, blindness, deafness, and feeblemindedness.~
@32759=~Omnipresence
(Alteration)

Level: 7
Range: Touch
Duration: 12 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The spell Omnipresence spreads the essence of the target creature throughout the area, allowing the creature to do actions at longer range than normal. For the duration or until dispelled, the creature can attack any creature in sight with any weapon, even with melee weapons. The creature can also target other creatures with touch spells at long range, and can cast spells at a target outside their visual range. However, these effects also go the other way. An omnipresent creature can be attacked with melee weapons and targeted by touch spells at long range. Since Omnipresence makes the creature's form less solid, the creature can move through other creatures while under the effects of the spell.~
@32760=~True Dispel
(Abjuration)

Level: 7
Sphere: Protection
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6 
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

A more powerful version of Dispel Magic, True Dispel removes all dispellable effects from creatures in the area of effect. Unlike Dispel Magic, True Dispel has a 100% chance of succeeding, regardless of level.~
@32761=~Volcanic Eruption
(Evocation)

Level: Quest
Sphere: Elemental Fire
Range: Special
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 12
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell triggers a small volcanic eruption centered on the caster. Multiple balls of lava (one per two caster levels) fly through the area in random directions and hit the ground in random spots. Each ball of lava deals 6d6 fire damage (Save vs. Breath for half) to all creatures within 15 feet of its landing point. The caster is completely unharmed by this spell, but <PRO_HISHER> allies are still in danger.~
@32762=~Elysium's Tears
(Conjuration)

Level: 7
Sphere: Sun
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell calls a storm of heavenly meteors (one per caster level), which fall down upon the area of effect. Each meteor deals 1d10 magic fire damage (Save vs. Spell at -5 for half) to all creatures within 5 feet of its impact point. The meteors will seek out evil creatures to strike, landing directly on them. If there are no evil creatures to hit, the meteors will strike random spots in the area of effect. The caster is unaffected by the spell. Elysium's Tears may only be cast by good characters.~
@32763=~Greater Living Lightning
(Evocation)

Level: Quest
Sphere: Elemental Air
Range: 0
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

Greater Living Lightning creates two lightning bolts that have minds of their own. These bolts will seek out enemies within 30 feet of the caster and repeatedly electrify them until they are dead, returning to the caster when there are no more enemies in range. Each time a bolt hits an enemy (which it does about once per second), it deals 1d6 electricity damage (Save vs. Breath at -4 for half). The spell creates another lightning bolt for every 10 levels after level 15.~
@32764=~Tornado
(Evocation)

Level: Quest
Sphere: Elemental Air, Weather
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

A much more powerful version of the spell Whirlwind, the spell creates a tornado that moves in the direction the caster aims at. Enemies that come within 10 feet of the tornado get sucked up into it, taking 3d8 per second that they stay inside it. Creatures are usually ejected from the tornado after about a round.~
@32765=~Spirit of Power
(Invocation)

Level: Quest
Sphere: All
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 30
Area of Effect: 1 party member
Saving Throw: None

For this spell to function, the party must consist of six clerics who worship the same deity (this means there cannot be more than one kit among clerics in the party, though having one or more unkitted clerics in the party will not prevent the spell from working). All six party members must cast Spirit of Power on a single party member. At the completion of the spell, each party member falls into a trance as their spirits meld together to form an avatar of their deity. This avatar inhabits the chosen party member for 1 hour, who can act while the other characters are incapacitated. Becoming an avatar of a god grants these benefits:

- +500 temporary Hit Points
- All attributes are set to 25
- +50% resistance to non-physical damage
- Magic Resistance set to 75%
- Can only be hit by +3 weapons or greater
- +1 attack per round
- +10 bonus to THAC0 and saving throws
- Deals an additional 8d6 magic damage with each hit
- Immune to disease, poison, and time stop
- Aura Cleansing
- Turns undead and casts priest spells as if 30 levels higher

The spell ends early if any party member dies or if any party member uses the End Spirit of Power special ability (which is given after the spell is cast). When the spell ends, all party members are left extremely drained, being reduced to 1 HP and greatly fatigued.~
@32766=~Contagious Fear
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: Quest
Sphere: War
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

Contagious Fear causes panic among creatures in a 15-foot radius, and the panic then spreads to other creatures. Each creature in the initial area of effect must Save vs. Spell with a -4 penalty or run in fear for 6 rounds. Any creature that comes within 15 feet of one of the panicking creatures must make the save as well, or else the Contagious Fear will spread to that creature. A creature that makes a save against this spell is immune to the spell for 1 round. After the spell expires on a creature, that creature is immune to the contagion for another 6 rounds.~

@34151=~Disruptive Surge
(Wild Magic)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

In using this spell, the Wild Mage deliberately employs wild magic to disrupt another creature's spell. The Wild Mage chooses a creature, which should be a spellcaster (arcane or divine). The next spell that creature casts within 5 rounds will trigger a wild surge. This surge will often cause the spell to fail, though it could have other, unpredictable effects.~
@34152=~Inertia
(Alteration)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell drastically increases the inertia of the target, locking its movement in the direction it is currently moving. The effect of this spell depends on whether or not the target was moving when it was hit by the spell. If it was moving, it will continue hurtling nonstop in that direction against its will for 4 rounds. If it was standing in place, it will be immobilized for 4 rounds. A successful Saving Throw vs. Polymorph at -6 negates the effects of this spell.

Creatures lower level than the caster have no save against this spell.~
@34153=~Detect Shapeshifters
(Divination)

Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Entire area
Saving Throw: None

This spell lets the caster see if any creatures are shapeshifters in disguise. After the spell is cast, all shapeshifters in the current area will glow purple briefly. In addition, the caster will be informed of what kind of shapeshifter each one is. Detect Shapeshifters can detect several different kinds of shapeshifters, including ones that have assumed a different physical form, such as doppelgangers and lycanthropes, as well as ones that appear a different form through illusionary magic, such as rakshasas. The shapeshifters themselves do not automatically realize they have been detected, and the spell does not necessarily cause them to revert to their true form.~
@34154=~Summon Kobold
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 8 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons a kobold with no special abilities. The kobold remains a faithful servant of the wizard for 8 rounds, at which point it is unsummoned. The kobold summoned by this spell ignores the summoning limit.~
@34155=~Dimension Door
(Alteration)

Level: 1
Range: Entire area
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell transports the caster to any point within the current area. When the spell is cast, a dimensional portal opens up in front of the caster, who immediately steps through it. Upon passing through the portal, the caster finds <PRO_HIMHER>self at <PRO_HISHER> chosen destination. Dimension Door can be cast at a point too far away to see, as long as the party has seen it.~
@34156=~Jump
(Alteration)

Level: 1
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows a creature to jump higher and farther. Until the duration ends, the creature gains an ability they can use at will, which lets the creature jump up to 26 feet away. The creature is able to jump over normally impassable obstacles like fences or walls, as long as they are narrow enough to jump over. While in the air, the creature is unaffected by certain ground-based spells like Entangle, Web, and Earthquake.~
@34157=~Hex
(Enchantment)

Level: 1
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell curses the target to take more magical and elemental damage. The target must make a Save vs. Polymorph. On a failure, the target is cursed for 6 rounds. During that time, whenever the target would be dealt fire, cold, electricity, acid, or magic damage, it takes an additional 6 damage of that type. Hex is especially effective when combined with spells that deal damage multiple times, such as Magic Missile or Melf's Acid Arrow. Hex can also be cast by Invokers.~
@34158=~Reflect Attack
(Abjuration)

Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: 8 hours or until hit
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

After this spell is cast, the next instance of physical damage the caster would receive is reflected back at the attacker, damaging them instead. If the physical damage came from a weapon, any on-hit effects of the weapon will also be reflected back at the attacker.~
@34159=~Taunt
(Enchantment)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The Taunt spell provokes an enemy into attacking the caster. If the target fails a Save vs. Breath, it is driven berserk and will attack the caster if possible rather than do any other action. If the target is a warrior (a fighter, ranger, paladin, or monk, including multiclassed warriors), it makes the save at a -6 penalty. Creatures immune to charm effects are immune to Taunt. The effects of Taunt end early if the caster dies.~
@34160=~Dimensional Chest
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons a chest containing an extradimensional storage space similar to a Bag of Holding. The chest can store up to 60000 of the party's items. It stays in the spot where it was summoned for 8 hours. Any party member can store or retrieve items from the chest by interacting with it. Non-allied creatures cannot see or interact with the chest.

All chests summoned with this spell link to the same extradimensional space, even if multiple chests were to be summoned at the same time.~
@34251=~Power Word, Pull
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When the wizard speaks a Power Word of Pulling, <PRO_HESHE> magically pulls another creature to <PRO_HIMHER>self. For one round, the creature will be unable to move of its own will and will be pulled toward the wizard at great speed. During that round, if the wizard moves, the creature will be dragged along with <PRO_HIMHER>. There is no Saving Throw, though Magic Resistance can prevent the effects. The caster can cast Power Word, Pull on a creature even if <PRO_HESHE> cannot see the creature; however, the caster must be aware of the creature's existence and they must be on the same plane. Power Word, Pull is technically a summoning spell, as it summons the target of the spell.~
@34252=~Ghostwalk
(Alteration)

Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell makes multiple allies partially ethereal for 1 round. While partially ethereal, creatures are immune to normal weapons and can move through walls. Ghostwalk could be used to move the party through a wall, eluding enemies. When the spell ends, if a character is inside a wall, they will be pushed to the nearest inhabitable space.~
@34253=~Power Word, Push
(Abjuration)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When the wizard speaks a Power Word of Pushing, <PRO_HESHE> magically pushes another creature away from <PRO_HIMHER>self. For one round, the creature will be unable to move of its own will and will be pushed away from the wizard at great speed. There is no Saving Throw, though Magic Resistance can prevent the effects. The caster can cast Power Word, Push on a creature even if <PRO_HESHE> cannot see the creature; however, the caster must be aware of the creature's existence and they must be on the same plane.~
@34254=~Intoxicate
(Enchantment)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The target of this spell will instantly become dangerously drunk, far more than is pleasurable. The target gains four intoxication points for every Constitution point they have less than 25. For example, if the target has 10 Constitution, they will gain 60 intoxication points. Like normal drunkenness, this magical intoxication will wear off over time.

Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: All allies
Saving Throw: None

Specific Spell Immunity lets the caster channel the power of their spells to shield the party from those same spells. The caster may choose up to three spells <PRO_HESHE> has memorized.

(Abjuration)

Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: 2 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This simple abjuration should be cast when the wizard sees another spellcaster in the midst of casting a spell at <PRO_HIMHER>. If the wizard would be hit by a spell within 2 rounds of casting, <PRO_HESHE> will be unaffected, and the incoming spell will be reflected back at its caster. Bounce Spell expires if it reflects a spell, or after 2 rounds have passed. Bounce Spell will not protect the caster from a Dispel Magic. However, it will not be affected by a Dispel Magic, either.~
@34259=~Detect Magic
(Divination)

Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster

(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: 2 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This simple but powerful spell should be cast when the wizard sees another spellcaster in the midst of casting a spell at <PRO_HIMHER>. It blocks the first spell (of any level) that hits the caster within the next 2 rounds. If a spell is blocked this way, the wizard absorbs its power, regaining a previously cast spell whose level is less than or equal to the level of the spell absorbed. For example, if the wizard is hit by a Finger of Death (7th-level spell), <PRO_HESHE> gets seven spell levels back-<PRO_HESHE> will regain one spell up to 7th level in power.~

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This is the necromantic version of the second-level spell Horror. All creatures in the area of effect, friend or foe, must save vs. wands at -4 or run away in fear for 1 turn. Unlike the spell Horror, Terror actually physically harms targets' minds. Although this spell affects allies, this does not bother the necromancer, for <PRO_HISHER> allies are undead.~

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to take control of a single slime creature for one turn. Since Control Slime is a particularly specialized spell, it is very effective: the slime gets no Saving Throw, and its Magic Resistance is no help. Control Slime has no effect on non-slimes.~

Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: The caster's familiar
Saving Throw: None

Familiar Spell imbues the caster's familiar with a spell. The caster chooses one of their 1st-level spells, consuming one use of that spell.

(Illusion)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster

The circle can be interacted with; by doing so the party can teleport to another circle with a different sigil sequence. Non-allied creatures cannot use these teleportation circles unless they are familiar with the sigil sequences.

Magical projectiles are also frozen immediately after being conjured. All creatures can still move and do actions while time is stopped.

@34751=~Mass Cast
(Alteration)

Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: 2 rounds
Casting Time: Instant
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Mass Cast modifies the next spell or ability used by the caster in the next 2 rounds. The area of effect of that spell or ability is changed such that it will apply the effects of the spell or ability to every creature within 15 feet of the target. This replaces whatever area of effect the spell or ability would have had.

Mass Cast has no casting time, can be cast immediately after another spell, and can be cast while the game is paused.~
@34752=~Far Sequencer
(Divination)

Level: 7
Range: 10000 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Far Sequencer allows the wizard to cast a spell at a target beyond the wizard's visual range. When cast, this spell prompts the wizard to choose a single spell of any level. That spell is immediately released, targeting a creature or point up to 10000 feet away with the spell. The range of the spell will be extended to 10000 feet unless it normally has a range of touch, in which case it should not be used with Far Sequencer. The wizard can target a creature or point <PRO_HESHE> cannot see directly, as long as the target can be seen by an ally or by another divination spell.~
@34753=~Forcecage
(Abjuration)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 10-ft. cube
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a cage of force - a cube with walls of force on each side. Creatures that were in the area of effect when the spell was cast are trapped in the forcecage for the duration. Creatures cannot enter or pass through the area of effect.~
@34754=~Stygian Ice Storm
(Conjuration)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

The signiture spell of gelugons, Stygian Ice Storm calls a storm of hellish ice from Stygia. Each creature in the area of effect takes 3d10 magical cold damage per round with no Saving Throw. In addition, arcane spellcasters in the area of effect forget three memorized spells each round due to the amnesia caused by Stygian ice. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or fiends. The caster is immune to <PRO_HISHER> own spell, but <PRO_HISHER> allies are not.~
@34755=~Death Trigger
(Necromancy)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent until death
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Death Trigger lets the caster store a single spell inside multiple allied creatures, to be released when they die. The caster must first choose a single spell of 3rd-level or lower. That spell is then stored inside each ally within 15 feet of the target, including summoned creatures. Each of these creatures will instantly cast their copy of the spell when they die. Note that the spell is treated as cast by the dying creature and at that creature's caster level (1 by default). If Death Trigger were to be cast again, the new spell would replace the previous spell stored in each target.

When selecting a spell, the caster can also choose whether the dying ally will release the spell on itself, on its previous attacker, or on the nearest enemy.~
@34756=~Critical Sequencer
(Enchantment)

Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent until triggered
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Critical Sequencer lets the caster cast spells through critical hits. The caster is prompted to store two spells of 3rd-level or lower, and the caster's weapons are temporarily imbued with those spells. The next time the caster gets a critical hit on a creature, <PRO_HESHE> instantly casts both spells on the creature. Furthermore, since the attack was a critical hit, each spell is cast twice on the creature. This will not happen if the critical hit is averted.~
@34757=~Reanimate
(Necromancy)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Nearest corpse in 3-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell "resurrects" the target as an undead creature under the caster's control. Reanimate cannot target a dead creature directly; it should be cast targeting the location of a corpse. The nearest dead creature to the target point, excluding undead, constructs, most extraplanar creatures, and creatures higher level than the caster, will be reanimated. The reanimated creature becomes undead, but can still use its abilities and spells. It is controlled by the caster until destroyed.~
@34758=~Skip Time
(Alteration)

Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The party
Saving Throw: None

This spell transports the party 10 rounds into the future. No time will have passed for the party, but 10 rounds will have passed for everyone and everything else. This means that all magical effects on creatures outside the party will have their remaining duration reduced by 10 rounds; short duration effects like Protection from Magical Weapons will expire. Lingering area of effect spells like Web and Stinking Cloud will also have their remaining duration reduced by 10 rounds.~
@34759=~Extraordinary Luck
(Enchantment)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 7 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

"Extraordinary" is definitely an understatement of the sheer amount of good fortune this spell gives the recipient. It is almost possible to *see* the way reality is warped as it accommodates the newfound luck of the individual.

For 7 rounds, the target gains 1 point of luck, a +1 bonus to all saving throws, and a +5% bonus to all thieving skills for every level of the caster.~
@34760=~Lightning Stream
(Evocation)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell releases a flurry of lightning bolts (one per level) at the target point. Each bolt deals 1d8 electricity damage, with a Save vs. Spell for half. The bolts travel in a line, bouncing off walls and potentially hitting the same creature more than once per bolt.~
@34762=~Insanity
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell makes a creature completely and dangerously insane. The target acts as they would under a Confusion effect: walking randomly, doing nothing, or attacking the nearest creature. A successful Save vs. Spell with a -4 penalty negates the effect. The insanity lasts until cured with a Heal spell or until dispelled.~
@34851=~Enhance Attribute
(Alteration)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 4 hours
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

An Enhance Attribute spell can vastly improve a single attribute of a creature. In casting this spell, the caster first chooses whether <PRO_HESHE> wishes to enhance a creature's Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. Then <PRO_HESHE> points at a creature, or chooses <PRO_HIMHER>self. The spell sets the chosen attribute of the target creature to 24 for the duration, or until dispelled. The spell has no effect if the chosen attribute of the creature is already higher than 24.~
@34852=~Globe of Invisibility
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 18-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a large, immobile sphere of illusionary magic. Any creature that enters the sphere becomes invisible. A creature can only become invisible via Globe of Invisibility once per round, even if there are multiple globes, though they become invisible regardless of when in the round they enter the area of effect. An effect that dispels illusionary protections will not dispel the globe, though it will dispel the invisibility that creatures obtained from the globe.~
@34853=~Otto's Irresistible Spin
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Otto's Irresistible Spin forces multiple creatures to spin in place against their will for 1 turn. Affected creatures will do nothing other than repeatedly spin in place, even if they see enemies. The spell is irresistible - there is no Saving Throw, and Magic Resistance will not block the spell. If an affected creature takes damage, the effects of the spell immediately end for that creature.~
@34854=~Recurring Contingency
(All)

Level: 8
Range: 0
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Recurring Contingency is like other Contingency spells, except that the stored spell is cast repeatedly. Upon casting Recurring Contingency, the caster is prompted to store a single spell of 2nd-level or lower, choose a target for the spell, and choose conditions under which the spell will be released. During the next hour, the spell will be cast on the target each round that the condition is met (or each time the caster is hit, if the caster chose it to trigger upon getting hit).~
@34855=~Omnipresence
(Alteration)

Level: 8
Range: Touch
Duration: 12 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The spell Omnipresence spreads the essence of the target creature throughout the area, allowing the creature to do actions at longer range than normal. For the duration or until dispelled, the creature can attack any creature in sight with any weapon, even with melee weapons. The creature can also target other creatures with touch spells at long range, and can cast spells at a target outside their visual range. However, these effects also go the other way. An omnipresent creature can be attacked with melee weapons and targeted by touch spells at long range. Since Omnipresence makes the creature's form less solid, the creature can move through other creatures while under the effects of the spell.~
@34856=~Contingency Curse
(Enchantment)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Contingency Curse forces a hostile creature to release spells against its will on the caster's terms. Upon casting Contingency Curse, the caster is prompted to store a single spell of 2nd-level or lower, choose a target for the spell, and choose conditions under which the spell will be released. The target of the spell is then cursed to cast that spell repeatedly under those conditions. For example, the caster could store a Web spell and make the creature cast Web on itself whenever it gets hit. Contingency Curse can only curse enemies.~
@34857=~Extend Vision
(Divination)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The spell Extend Vision allows the recipient to see much farther than <PRO_HESHE> could see before. The recipient will be able to see creatures that are too far away to return the gaze. More importantly, the recipient can target those creatures with spells and ranged attacks from far away. Extend Vision also makes the recipient immune to blindness. It lasts for 8 hours or until dispelled.~
@34858=~Sphere of Reversed Gravity
(Alteration)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 18-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a large spherical area that reverses the gravity of creatures inside it. Any creature that enters the area of effect will start falling up. While in the air, the creature cannot move unless it can fly or levitate, and it is unaffected by ground-based spells such as Grease, Entangle, Web and Earthquake.~
@34859=~False Life
(Necromancy)

Level: 8
Range: Touch
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell bolsters a creature's life force through necromancy. For 8 hours, the target gains 10 temporary hit points per caster level. However, this arcane form of pseudo-healing has a flaw: for the duration, the target cannot regain any hit points through spells, abilities, items, resting, or regeneration.~
@34860=~Enslave
(Enchantment)

Level: 8
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

An especially potent mind-control spell, Enslave will make the target a permanent thrall of the caster. If the target fails its Save vs. Spell at -4, it is dominated by the caster until the effect is dispelled. The enslaved creature will not take any actions unless ordered by the caster, and it will not turn hostile if hurt by a party member. Undead and constructs are unaffected by Enslave.~
@34861=~Polar Ray
(Evocation)

Level: 8
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 2 ft. by 30 ft. jet
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting Polar Ray, the caster emits a powerful beam of frost at the target. The target and all creatures between the caster and the target take 12d6 cold damage. The polar ray deals the same damage again half a round later to the target and anyone who is still in the ray's path.~
@34862=~Clone Other
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 16 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

An offensive version of Simulacrum, Clone Other creates a simulacrum of another creature. The simulacrum is under the caster's control. The caster cannot clone <PRO_HIMHER>self, and the target's level must be less than or equal to the caster's. The simulacrum is at 60% of the target's level and has 60% of their Hit Points.~
@34863=~Metafireball
(Evocation)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Also known as Fireballball, this spell launches a fireball that explodes into other fireballs. After the Metafireball explodes, each creature in the area of effect is hit by a separate fireball with its own area of effect. Each of the secondary fireballs deals 3d6 fire damage (Save vs. Spell for half). This spell is most effective when cast at a large group of creatures clumped together.~
@34951=~Perfect Invisibility
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 9
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the ultimate form of invisibility. While under the effect of Perfect Invisibility, a creature can attack, cast a spell or otherwise interact with another creature or object while remaining completely invisible. However, Perfect Invisibility can still be dispelled by effects that would dispel regular invisibility, such as True Sight or Dispel Magic. Barring such removal, the spell will last for 3 rounds. Perfect Invisibility can only be cast by Illusionists.~
@34952=~Mass Domination
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 9
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 12 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 25-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

The Mass Domination spell enables the caster to control the actions of a group of creatures while the spell is in effect. This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victims. Unlike the 4th-level priest spell Mental Domination, the targets have no option for release, even if made to do something against their morals. This effect can only be reversed by Dispel Magic. The targets are allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty to negate the effect.~
@34953=~Attain Perfection
(Alteration)

Level: 9
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell temporarily makes the target perfect in every way. For 1 hour, the target's Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all set to 25.~
@34954=~Vampiric Feast
(Necromancy)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 6 hours
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Perhaps the most powerful life-draining spell, Vampiric Feast allows the caster to absorb Hit Points from many victims at once. Every creature in a 15-foot radius takes 30 damage with no Saving Throw. For every creature dealt damage this way, the caster gains 30 temporary hit points. Hit points gained this way are cumulative; the caster can gain a massive amount of health by draining many creatures with Vampiric Feast. The bonus hit points last for six hours.~
@34955=~Mass Sequencer
(Invocation)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Mass Sequencer allows the caster to cast one of <PRO_HISHER> spells on many creatures simultaneously. When Mass Sequencer is cast, the caster is prompted to store a single spell of 3rd-level or lower. Once activated, the sequencer will cast copies of the stored spell on every creature in a 15-foot radius around the target. For example, if the caster stores a Fireball spell and then activates the sequencer on a 15' radius area containing four creatures, then four fireballs will be launched, each targeting a different creature.

At higher levels, the maximum spell level that can be stored in a Mass Sequencer increases:

Caster Level                   Maximum Spell Level
18 and below                   3
19-24                          4
25-30                          5
31-36                          6
37-42                          7
43-48                          8
49 and above                   9~
@34956=~Enoll Eva's Duplication
(Alteration)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This strange, fantastic spell hails from the Planes, where it was the byproduct of esoteric mathematical research by the modron mathemagician Enoll Eva. While Enoll Eva's Duplication is active, the caster's actions are multiplied by 2. The caster attacks twice as many times per round, and whenever <PRO_HESHE> casts a spell, <PRO_HESHE> immediately casts that spell an additional time, without using up a spell slot. Note that some spells do not stack and thus will not have double the effect when cast twice.~
@34957=~Executioner's Eyes
(Divination)

Level: 9
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius

(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 9
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates an illusory adult red dragon, which will serve the caster for the duration. The illusory dragon has only 20% the hit points of a real dragon of the same age, and its attacks deal nonlethal damage, but its stats are otherwise the same as those of a real dragon, and it has the same abilities, including fire breath and an aura of fear.~
@34959=~Damage Turning
(Abjuration) 

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None 

Damage Turning reflects damage from the caster back to the attacker. While Damage Turning is active, any damage that would be dealt to the caster from an attack, spell or ability is prevented. The source is dealt the full damage they would have dealt the caster. Other effects of attacks, spells, and abilities are not reflected; just the damage. Damage Turning can only be cast by Abjurers.~
@34960=~Eclectic Recall
(All)

Level: 10
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Eclectic Recall restores spells the caster has cast previously, so that the spells may be cast again. Up to eight spells are restored, no more than one per school of magic. Eclectic Recall prioritizes restoring higher-level spells over lower-level spells.

All the spells restored must be 6th-level or lower. Eclectic Recall can restore 7th-level spells once the caster reaches level 24, and 8th-level spells once the caster reaches level 30.~
@34961=~Teleport Step
(Alteration)

Level: 9
Range: Touch
Duration: 4 hours
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Among the greatest teleportation spells, Teleport Step lets the recipient teleport anywhere in the area any number of times. The recipient must simply start moving toward a destination, and they will instantly find themself at that destination.~
@34962=~Necropotence
(Necromancy)

Level: 10
Range: 0
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Necropotence allows the wizard to draw the power for their spells through their own life force. For the duration, whenever the character would cast a spell, they immediately regain the cast spell but also take 3 damage per level of the spell. This damage cannot be prevented by any resistances, but it will not interrupt the spell.~
@34963=~Mental Agility
(Enchantment)

Level: 10
Range: 0
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Mental Agility drastically shortens the time necessary to cast spells. The wizard's casting time is reduced by 10 for the duration. Mental Agility cannot be combined with Improved Alacrity.~
@34964=~Freezing Wave
(Evocation)

Level: 10
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 15
Area of Effect: 60-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

When cast, this spell creates an enormous wave of frost emanating from the caster in all directions. Creatures within 60 feet take 1d10 cold damage per level (Save vs. Breath at -4 for half). The caster is unaffected.~
@34965=~Rampant Lightning
(Evocation)

Level: 10
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

Rampant Lightning causes a great electrical explosion, releasing lightning bolts in all directions. Two lightning bolts are released per caster level, each one dealing 1d6 electricity damage (Save vs. Breath at -4 for half). It would be wise to make the entire party immune to electricity before casting this spell.~
@34966=~Protection From Time Stop
(Abjuration)

Level: 9
Range: Touch
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell gains the ability to move and do actions while time is stopped. Protection from Time Stop can either be used as a defense when an enemy casts Time Stop, or as a means of offense when another ally casts Time Stop. Unlike other abjuration spells, Protection from Time Stop can be learned by Transmuters.~
@34967=~Culling Thought
(Necromancy, Enchantment)

Level: 10
Range: Special
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to slay weak creatures with a thought. For the duration, the caster gains the Culling Thought ability, which kills a creature with current HP less than or equal to the caster's level plus their Intelligence (so a 20th-level caster with 18 Intelligence could kill any creature with 38 HP or less). This ability can be used at will and as a free action, and can target any creature the party sees, even if the caster does not see it. If the target is not killed by Culling Thought, it remains unaware of the attempt and will not turn hostile.~
@34968=~Sphere of Annihilation
(Conjuration/Summoning) 

Level: 10
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell creates a sphere of annihilation, which appears as a black ball with a 5 foot radius. The sphere of annihilation is a hole in the fabric of the multiverse. Any matter that touches it is utterly destroyed. If a creature crosses the sphere's path, the creature must make a Save vs. Breath at -3 to dodge the sphere; otherwise, the creature is disintegrated. Even on a successful save, the creature takes 5d6 damage.

The sphere can be moved by the caster, but doing so requires enormous mental power. The higher the caster's Intelligence, the faster the sphere can be moved. The intense concentration used in controlling the sphere prevents the caster from casting any more spells while this spell is active.~

@35374=~Standing before you is a djinni of immense power, the air thick with electricity around it. It regards you coolly. "Greetings to you, spellweaver. Are you ready to begin negotiations?"~
@35375=~The djinni grins widely, winking at you. "Perhaps the wisest of courses, spellweaver. Very well... it shall be as you wish."~

@35378=~"It is that formulation that requires negotiation." The djinni pulls a quill and a paper scroll from the air, grinning. "Since you do not have years to waste, you will attempt to describe to me what you desire from your wish."~
@35379=~"And I," here the djinni looks pleased, "will use my vast intelligence to distort your purpose as I please. Don't feel bad... the forces at work here are such that it is not often that one gets what one truly hopes for."~
@35380=~"But you can certainly try. The wise often do well... and you spellweavers are often quite wise, yes?" It taps its quill thoughtfully on its head. "Do you wish to begin, then?"~
@35381=~The djinni nods. "As you say." Quickly, the two of you begin negotiating a complex contract. The djinni is tricky, carefully attempting to twist your meaning with words, legal phrases, and clauses that you can barely understand...~
@35382=~Fortunately, you are quick to catch on. Before long, you begin tricking the djinni's phrasings yourself, leaving it quite frustrated. You still doubt you'll get what you want, but chances are the djinni won't be able to trick you.~
@35383=~You are wise enough to keep pace with the djinni, preventing the being from taking total advantage of you. Still... the contract is hard to understand, and you wonder at the end result.~
@35384=~Throughout the process, the djinni continues to baffle you... and you are not even sure if your desired wish will be similar to your original premise. At best, you stall the worst of the clauses.~
@35385=~Your lack of wisdom leaves you at a complete disadvantage. Throughout the writing of the contract, the djinni all but bullies you mentally into a position of watching him all but write the complex document on his own... there are few objections you can make.~
@35386=~The contract complete, the djinni dons a pair of spectacles and looks it over with an arched brow. "Very well, spellcaster. I can interpret the items listed here in the following ways. Choose carefully which you would prefer."~
@35387=~I am ready.~
@35388=~Negotiations? What do you mean?~
@35389=~I don't have time to negotiate in the middle of combat!~
@35390=~No, I have changed my mind. Return to whence you came.~
@35391=~Then explain to me what you meant by negotiations.~
@35392=~Then let us begin.~
@35393=~Never mind. Return to where you came from, djinni.~
@35394=~But we don't have time to do all this in the middle of combat!~

@35701=~You can now gain a metamagic ability. These abilities empower the next spell you cast, but cause it to use up a higher-level spell slot. Choose one to see its description:~

@36001=~Widen Spell~
@36002=~Widen Spell
(Metamagic)

Spell Level Increase: +1

Widen Spell increases the area of effect of the character's next spell by 50%. For example, a fireball will have a 22-foot radius rather than a 15-foot radius. Widen Spell does nothing to spells that do not have an area of effect.~
@36003=~Maximize Spell~
@36004=~Maximize Spell
(Metamagic)

Spell Level Increase: +3

Maximize Spell causes the character's next spell to deal maximum damage or restore the maximum number of hit points.~
@36005=~Extend Spell~
@36006=~Extend Spell
(Metamagic)

Spell Level Increase: +1

Extend Spell doubles the duration of the character's next spell. Extend Spell cannot extend spell effects with a base duration of less than 5 rounds.~
@36007=~Safe Spell~
@36008=~Safe Spell
(Metamagic)

Spell Level Increase: +1

Safe Spell lets the character shape the area of their next spell to avoid harming allies. Their next spell will only harm enemies if it is an area of effect spell.~
@36009=~Intensify Spell~
@36010=~Intensify Spell
(Metamagic)

Spell Level Increase: +1 to +8

Intensify Spell makes the character's next spell harder to resist. The character can choose how many spell levels to increase the spell by; for each level increase, any saving throw against the spell is made at an additional -1 penalty.~
@36011=~Empower Spell~
@36012=~Empower Spell
(Metamagic)

Spell Level Increase: +2

Empower Spell increases most numerical characteristics of the character's next spell by 50%. Characteristics that can be increased this way include damage, healing, and stat bonuses.~
@36013=~Quicken Spell~
@36014=~Quicken Spell
(Metamagic)

Spell Level Increase: +2

Quicken Spell lets the character cast their next spell instantly. Not only does the quickened spell have no casting time, it can be cast even if the character has already cast another spell in the same round. However, no more than one spell can be quickened per round.~
@36015=~Persistent Spell~
@36016=~Persistent Spell
(Metamagic)

Spell Level Increase: +4

Persistent Spell sets the duration of the character's next spell to one day. This stacks with Extend Spell, which will extend the duration to two days if both are used. Persistent Spell cannot extend spell effects with a base duration of less than 5 rounds.~
@36017=~Mass Spell~
@36018=~Mass Spell
(Metamagic)

Spell Level Increase: +5

Mass Spell lets the character cast their next spell in an area of effect. The spell will affect all creatures within 15 feet of the target. Mass Spell works with spells that are normally single-target, even if they normally only affect the caster, like Mirror Image. However, since Mass Spell replaces the spell's original area of effect, it will not work well with spells that already had an area of effect.~
@36019=~Irresistible Spell~
@36020=~Irresistible Spell
(Metamagic)

Spell Level Increase: +5

Irresisitible Spell makes the character's next spell offer no Saving Throw. Irresistible Spell can only be used with spell effects that weaken or damage the target; it does not work with effects that kill or disable the target, including stun, paralysis, hold, charm, confusion, fear, feeblemind, blindness, petrification, polymorph, instant death, or disintegration.~

This spell amplifies the influence a priest has over undead, though it is tied to the area surrounding the priest at the moment of its casting and does not move.

Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Special

This spell instantly destroys a target, blasting it into small chunks. The victim is allowed a Save vs. Death at a penalty of -4; if successful, the target takes 8d6 points of magic damage instead of being destroyed. Unlike the similar 5th-level spell Slay Living, Destruction destroys the target with divine force rather than with negative energy; therefore, it can affect undead, constructs, and extraplanar creatures.~

(Evocation)

Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: 10 rounds
Casting Time: 10
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a staff of force in the caster's hand. It is treated as a magical weapon, doing 1d1+9 crushing damage per hit, and it can hit creatures that require +10 weapons to hit, though it has no bonus to hit. The Decastave uses the quarterstaff proficiency, though it gives the wielder proficiency in quarterstaves if <PRO_HESHE> is not already proficient. The staff also drains 10 Hit Points from the target with each hit, restoring 10 Hit Points to the wielder.~

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell turns a target's blood to flame, doing 3d4 Hit Points of damage every round and driving the victim berserk with pain. The target gets to save vs. Spell at -4 every round; if successful, the damage and berserk state are negated. This spell does not work against undead or extraplanar creatures that do not have blood (such as elementals). If the creature is resistant to fire, this resistance will lower or nullify the damage from this spell.~
@44427=~Emotion, Courage

Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 7-ft. radius

(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 15 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 7-ft. radius

@44430=~Mordenkainen's Force Missiles
(Invocation)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 2-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a brilliant globe of magical energy that streaks forth from the caster's hand to unerringly strike its target, much like a Magic Missile spell. The wizard creates one missile at 7th level and an additional missile at every third level after 7th-in other words, two missiles at 10th level, three at 13th, four at 16th, and so on, to a maximum of seven missiles at 25th level. Each missile inflicts 2d4 points of damage to the target and then bursts in a 2-ft. radius concussive blast that inflicts 1 point of damage per level of the caster-for example, a 12th-level wizard could conjure two force missiles, each of which strikes for 2d4+12 points of magic damage. Creatures taking damage can attempt a Save vs. Spell to negate the concussion damage, but the impact of the missile itself allows no Saving Throw. The 1st-level wizard spell Shield will absorb the force missiles harmlessly, including the concussion damage.~
@44431=~Shout
(Invocation)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 17-ft. cone with 15-deg. arc
Saving Throw: Special

Shout grants the wizard tremendous vocal powers, allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to emit an earsplitting roar from <PRO_HISHER> mouth in a cone-shaped area of effect. Any creature within this area is deafened for 9 rounds and suffers 10d6 points of magic damage. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half. The targets are also knocked back, whether they make the save or not.~
@44432=~Vitriolic Sphere
(Conjuration)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell conjures a sphere of glowing emerald acid that the caster can direct to strike any target within range. When it reaches its target, the sphere explodes and drenches the victim in potent acid. The victim suffers 1d4 points of acid damage per caster level, to a maximum of 12d4 points of damage. After the initial damage, the victim must save vs. Spell to avoid more damage. If unsuccessful, the victim continues to suffer acid damage in the following rounds, sustaining two less dice of damage each round. For example, an 8th-level wizard inflicts 8d4 damage with this spell on the first round, 6d4 on the second round, 4d4 on the third round, 2d4 on the fourth round, and the spell ends on the fifth round. Each round after the first, the victim is entitled to a Save vs. Spell to avoid further damage.

The vitriolic sphere also splashes acid in a 5-ft. radius around the primary target. Any creatures within the splash radius must save vs. Petrification/Polymorph or suffer a splash hit that inflicts 1d4 points of damage per every five levels of the caster. Splash hits do not cause continuing damage.~
@44524=~Shroud of Flame
(Invocation)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/2 levels (special)
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes a creature to burst into flames, with no Saving Throw possible. The creature will burn for 2d6 points of fire damage every round, and gouts of flame erupt from the burning target, causing any creatures within 5 ft. to take 1d4 points of fire damage from the flames. Anyone hit by the victim's flames will contract the shroud themselves. The shroud of flame dissipates if the caster and target are no longer in the same area.~
@44610=~Antimagic Shell
(Abjuration)

Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell surrounds the caster with an invisible barrier that moves with <PRO_HIMHER>. This barrier makes the wizard immune to any magical attacks, but it prevents <PRO_HIMHER> from casting spells.

Antimagic Shell also dispels deafness and feeblemindedness in the caster.~
@44626=~Lich Touch
(Necromancy)

Level: 6
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Special

This spell confers the powers of a lich's touch and a lich's immunities upon the caster. The wizard gains immunity to paralysis and fear while the spell is in effect, and <PRO_HISHER> hands glow with an unearthly blue radiance. When the wizard attacks a creature with the lich's touch, that creature takes 1d2 fist damage (plus Strength bonus) and 3d10 magic cold damage, and the creature must Save vs. Paralysis at -2 or be paralyzed for 3 rounds. Undead and constructs only take the fist damage and are not paralyzed. The lich's touch can affect creatures that require +6 weapons in order to hit.~
@44631=~Soul Eater
(Necromancy)

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 7-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell deals 6d8 magic damage to all hostile living creatures within a 14-ft. radius. Any creatures that die as a result of this damage are obliterated, and their essence is transformed into a skeleton warrior under control of the caster. Also, for each creature that dies in this manner, the caster gains 10 temporary hit points for 8 hours. Soul Eater has no effect on undead, constructs, and elemental creatures.~
@44724=~Acid Storm
(Evocation)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell unleashes an acidic downpour on the area of effect, doing 1d4 points of acid damage each round for the first three rounds, 1d6 points for the next three rounds, and 1d8 points for each round thereafter. Moving out of the area of effect does not stop the damage-the acid adheres to the skin, and any creatures in the area of effect when Acid Storm is cast continue to suffer acid damage as long as the spell duration lasts. Creatures make a Save vs. Spell every round after they have been hit by the cloud-if successful, they only take half damage (for that round only).~
@44726=~Suffocate
(Necromancy)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 7-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell draws the breath out of all creatures within the area of effect. Creatures that do not breathe are unaffected. Suffocating creatures suffer -4 to Armor Class, -4 to hit, -6 to Dexterity, one less attack per round, half movement rate, and take 4d8 points of magic damage per round. A successful Save vs. Breath at -4 negates all effects but 2d8 points of damage for one round. The effects begin to fade when the creature moves out of the area of effect, although it can take a round for a character to catch their second wind.~
@44814=~Iron Body
(Alteration)

Level: 8
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell transforms the caster's body into living iron, granting <PRO_HIMHER> several powerful resistances and abilities. While the spell is in effect, the caster is 100% resistant to fire and poison, and 25% resistant to all physical damage. Spells that affect respiration or the physiology of the caster, such as Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting, Flaying, or Drown, are ignored. In addition, the caster's Strength is raised to 25.

Unfortunately, the caster's movement becomes slow and awkward, setting <PRO_HISHER> movement rate to 25% of <PRO_HISHER> normal.~
