Additionally, <PRO_HESHE> has greater influence over the creature, urging it to be more aggressive in its attacks, granting it a +1 critical threat rolls.

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Snake's Swiftness allows a single creature to move and attack extremely fast for a single round. During the round, the creature's movement rate and attacks per round are doubled. In addition, if the target is an animal, a lycanthrope, a yuan-ti, or a character shapeshifted into one such creature, it is sped up further, gaining 2 additional attacks per round and moving at the maximum possible movement rate for the duration.~
@32152=~Hex
(Enchantment)

Level: 1
Sphere: Numbers
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell curses the target to take more magical and elemental damage. The target must make a Save vs. Polymorph. On a failure, the target is cursed for 6 rounds. During that time, whenever the target would be dealt fire, cold, electricity, acid, or magic damage, it takes an additional 6 damage of that type. Hex is especially effective when combined with spells that deal damage multiple times, such as Magic Missile or Melf's Acid Arrow. Hex can only be cast by evil-aligned characters.~

(Divination)

Level: 1
Sphere: Divination
Range: 10000 ft.
Duration: 1 hour

By casting Hunter's Mark, the ranger magically marks a non-allied creature to be hunted. For the duration, the ranger's attacks against the marked target deal an additional 1d6 damage, plus another 1d6 for every 10 levels of the ranger. In addition, when the target is out of sight, the spell greatly enhances the ranger's ability to track the target, sufficient for the ranger to know the target's exact location and direction. Hunter's Mark can be cast on any creature the party sees, even if the ranger does not see them.~

(Enchantment)

Level: 1
Sphere: Combat

Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 3

(Divination)

Level: 2
Sphere: Animal, Divination
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The Beast Sense spell allows the druid to see through the eyes of an animal and sense what it senses. For the duration of the spell or until dispelled, the party can see any creature or object that the animal can see. Beast Sense does not by itself allow the druid to control the animal, though it could be cast on a charmed animal for use as a scout. The spell has no effect on a creature that isn't an animal.~
@32252=~Fiery Link
(Evocation)

Level: 2
Sphere: Elemental Fire
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: All creatures in a narrow line between the caster and an ally
Saving Throw: 1/2

In casting Fiery Link, the caster must choose an allied creature other than <PRO_HIMHER>self. This spell creates a ray of fire linking the caster and that ally, damaging any creatures in between. If the caster and/or the ally move, the fiery link will stretch and contract to fill the distance between them. Every three seconds, any creature that crosses the fiery link (not including the caster or the ally) takes 1d8 fire damage (Save vs. Breath for half). A single caster can cast Fiery Link on multiple allies, but a single ally cannot be targeted by more than one Fiery Link at once.~

(Necromancy)

Level: 2
Sphere: Healing
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 day
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature

Level: 2
Sphere: Combat
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 3 rounds or until a critical hit
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Critical Boon empowers an ally, allowing them to get a guaranteed critical hit on their next attack. If the target attacks a creature that is immune to critical hits, the spell won't trigger, saving the effect for when the target attacks a creature that isn't immune.~
@32255=~Ghostwalk
(Alteration)

Level: 2
Sphere: Travelers
Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows a creature to float a short distance through a wall or across a gap. After the spell is cast on a creature, the next time that creature moves in a direction, it will instead ghostwalk in that direction. For 3 seconds, that creature will float in a straight line in that direction, passing through normally impassable obstacles. After 3 seconds, the effect ends; if the creature is in an impassable area at that time, it will instantly jump to the nearest inhabitable space.~
@32351=~Call Water Weirds
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 3
Sphere: Summoning, Elemental Water
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Entire area
Saving Throw: None

This spell temporarily calls water weirds into existence in bodies of water in the current area. These water weirds will fight on the side of whoever cast this spell most recently - if an enemy casts this spell, the water weirds will be hostile, but will switch to the party's side if a party member then casts this spell as well. Unlike other summoning spells, this spell does not summon creatures directly to the caster's side; instead, it spawns water weirds in specific bodies of water in the current area. If the current area does not have any bodies of water large enough for a water weird, the spell does nothing.~
@32352=~Shortening
(Alteration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Numbers
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Shortening halves the duration of certain effects on the target creature. If the target is an enemy, then all non-harmful effects on the target will have their duration halved. If the target is not an enemy, then all harmful effects on the target will have their duration halved. A "harmful effect" is any effect from a spell or ability that turns a non-hostile creature hostile. The duration is halved from the total duration of the effect, not the remaining duration. An effect can only be shortened once.~
@32353=~Fire Curse
(Alteration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Elemental Fire
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell can only be cast on enemies. For the duration, all damage dealt to the target is converted to fire damage, regardless of the original damage type. The creature will be dealt damage based on its fire resistance, not its resistance to the original damage type. Physical damage converted to fire damage will bypass Stoneskin. There is no saving throw, though magic resistance can still block the spell.~
@32354=~Healing Curse
(Alteration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Healing
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

Healing Curse causes a creature's attacks to heal rather than harm. If the recipient is an ally, there is no Saving Throw necessary; otherwise, the recipient may make a Save vs. Polymorph at -2 to avoid the effects. While affected by Healing Curse, any damage the creature would deal through attacks, spells or abilities is negated, and the creature that would have been damaged is instead healed by the amount of damage they would have taken.~
@32355=~Guardian Magic
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Guardian
Range: 5 ft.
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 7

Level: 3
Sphere: Elemental Air
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2

(Alteration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Travelers
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This wondrous spell gives a creature the power to fly. For the duration, the creature can fly over normally impassable objects such as houses, walls, and rivers, but only as long as the creature is outdoors. The higher level the caster, the faster the creature's flying speed. The creature is also unaffected by ground-based spells such as Grease, Web, Entangle, and Earthquake.~
@32358=~Familiar Spell
(Conjuration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Combat, Summoning
Range: Familiar must be in the same area
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: The caster's familiar
Saving Throw: None

Familiar Spell imbues the Beastmaster's familiar with a spell. The caster chooses one of their 1st-level spells, consuming one use of that spell. For the next 8 hours, each time their familiar hits a creature with an attack, it instantly casts a copy of the chosen spell on the target. The spell is cast at the level of the familiar's owner, not at the level of the familiar. The familiar must be owned by the caster, and it must be in the same area as the caster when Familiar Spell is cast (and not in the caster's inventory).~
@32360=~Recall Party
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 3
Sphere: Summoning
Range: Infinite
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: All party members
Saving Throw: None

Recall Party teleports all party members to the caster's side. The range is unlimited, and party members can be drawn from a different area, so long as they are on the same plane as the caster.~

(Enchantment)

Level: 4
Sphere: Combat
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 8 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

The spell Disarm causes creatures' weapons to disappear. Each enemy in the area of effect must make a Save vs. Wands at -2. On a failure, that creature's weapon vanishes temporarily, and the creature is forced to fight with its fists. For the duration, the creature cannot equip another weapon - if it does so, that weapon vanishes as well. The creature's weapons reappear if it dies before the duration expires. Disarm has no effect if the target is using a natural weapon or does not have a weapon in any of its quickslots.~
@32452=~Forest's Blessing

Sphere: Plant

Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster

Level: 4
Sphere: Guardian
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

Turn Creature allows the priest to turn a non-undead creature. Once the spell is cast, the target creature must Save vs. Polymorph at -4. On a failure, the creature is turned as if it was an undead creature affected by the priest's Turn Undead ability. Depending on the level of the target, the level of the priest, the alignment of the priest, and random chance, the target may either be forced to run away from the priest temporarily, controlled by the priest temporarily, or killed instantly.~
@32454=~Wall of Fire
(Evocation)

Level: 4
Sphere: Elemental Fire
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 8 ft. long, 2 ft. wide wall
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a wall of raging flames. Any creature who attempts to pass through the wall takes 1d4 fire damage per caster level, up to a maximum of 12d4 at level 12. There is no Saving Throw, since the flames cannot be dodged except by going around the wall. A creature that has passed through a Wall of Fire cannot take damage from passing through a Wall of Fire again for 1 round.~
@32551=~Prolongment
(Alteration)

Level: 5
Sphere: Numbers
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Prolongment doubles the duration of certain effects on the target creature. If the target is an enemy, then all harmful effects on the target will have their duration doubled. If the target is not an enemy, then all non-harmful effects on the target will have their duration doubled. A "harmful effect" is any effect from a spell or ability that turns a non-hostile creature hostile. The duration is doubled from the total duration of the effect, not the remaining duration. An effect can only be prolonged once.~
@32552=~Wall of Force

Sphere: Guardian
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 8 ft. long, 2 ft. wide wall
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a wall of magical force, which stays for 5 rounds. Creatures cannot pass through the wall, though they can still fly over it, teleport past it, or float past it while ethereal. The wall cannot be dispelled.~
@32554=~Ethereal Jaunt
(Alteration)

Level: 5
Sphere: Travelers
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell turns the caster partially ethereal for a short period of time. While partially ethereal, the caster is immune to non-magical weapons, but is still tangible enough to be able to attack and cast spells. The caster can also move through walls while partially ethereal (unlike the Fly spell, this also works indoors). Simply click on a point to move to, and the caster will float to that point, bypassing normally impassable obstacles in the way.~
@32555=~Critical Spell
(Enchantment)

Level: 5
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Duration: 2 hours
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Critical Spell lets the caster repeatedly cast a spell through critical hits. The caster is prompted to store a single 1st-level spell, and the caster's weapons are temporarily imbued with that spell. For the duration, whenever the caster gets a critical hit on a creature, <PRO_HESHE> instantly casts a copy of the stored spell. This will not happen if the critical hit is averted. The caster can also store a 2nd-level spell if they are level 20 or higher, and an additional spell level higher for every ten levels after 20.~

Sphere: Elemental Water
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell effectively causes a creature to drown, whether or not that creature is currently underwater. When cast, the target must Save vs. Breath at -2. On a failure, the target's lungs become filled with water, and the target immediately takes nonlethal damage equal to 90% of its maximum hit points, knocking it unconscious if it would be reduced to 1 Hit Point. For 5 rounds, the target also suffers -4 AC, -4 THAC0, -6 Dexterity, and -1 attack per round. Drown has no effect on undead, constructs, elementals, or other creatures that don't breathe.~

Level: 6
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell functions like an antimagic shell, except it blocks damage instead of magic. For the duration, the recipient is immune to damage but cannot deal any damage. The recipient can still move, attack, and cast spells, but any damage those attacks or spells would deal is prevented.~

Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature

Level: 7
Sphere: Healing
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 0

This spell causes enormous vines to burst forth from the ground throughout the area of effect. Creatures within 60 feet of the caster must Save vs. Paralysis at -6 each round or be immobilized, completely entangled by giant vines. Even large creatures such as giants and dragons can be entangled this way.~
@32755=~Enhance Attribute
(Alteration)

Level: 7
Sphere: Combat, Thought
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 4 hours
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

An Enhance Attribute spell can vastly improve a single attribute of a creature. In casting this spell, the caster first chooses whether <PRO_HESHE> wishes to enhance a creature's Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. Then <PRO_HESHE> points at a creature, or chooses <PRO_HIMHER>self. The spell sets the chosen attribute of the target creature to 24 for the duration, or until dispelled. The spell has no effect if the chosen attribute of the creature is already higher than 24.~
@32756=~Contingent Resurrection
(Necromancy)

Level: Quest
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent until triggered
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 

This spell stores a Resurrection spell in the target, to be released when the creature dies. The slain creature is automatically brought back to life and immediately restored to full health. Contingent Resurrection then ends, and cannot be applied to the same creature again for 7 days.~
@32757=~Reanimate
(Necromancy)

Level: 7
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Nearest corpse in 3-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell "resurrects" the target as an undead creature under the caster's control. Reanimate cannot target a dead creature directly; it should be cast targeting the location of a corpse. The nearest dead creature to the target point, excluding undead, constructs, most extraplanar creatures, and creatures higher level than the caster, will be reanimated. The reanimated creature becomes undead, but can still use its abilities and spells. It is controlled by the caster until destroyed. Reanimate cannot be cast by good characters.~
@32758=~Mass Heal
(Necromancy)

Level: Quest
Sphere: Healing
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 15
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Mass Heal applies the effects of Heal to all allies in the area of effect. Creatures affected regain all hit points, and are cured of disease, blindness, deafness, and feeblemindedness.~
@32759=~Omnipresence
(Alteration)

Level: 7
Range: Touch
Duration: 12 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The spell Omnipresence spreads the essence of the target creature throughout the area, allowing the creature to do actions at longer range than normal. For the duration or until dispelled, the creature can attack any creature in sight with any weapon, even with melee weapons. The creature can also target other creatures with touch spells at long range, and can cast spells at a target outside their visual range. However, these effects also go the other way. An omnipresent creature can be attacked with melee weapons and targeted by touch spells at long range. Since Omnipresence makes the creature's form less solid, the creature can move through other creatures while under the effects of the spell.~
@32760=~True Dispel
(Abjuration)

Level: 7
Sphere: Protection
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6 
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

A more powerful version of Dispel Magic, True Dispel removes all dispellable effects from creatures in the area of effect. Unlike Dispel Magic, True Dispel has a 100% chance of succeeding, regardless of level.~

@34151=~Disruptive Surge
(Wild Magic)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

In using this spell, the Wild Mage deliberately employs wild magic to disrupt another creature's spell. The Wild Mage chooses a creature, which should be a spellcaster (arcane or divine). That creature must make a Save vs. Polymorph at -8. If it fails the save, the next spell it casts within 5 rounds will trigger a wild surge. This surge will often cause the spell to fail, though it could have other, unpredictable effects.~
@34152=~Inertia
(Alteration)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell drastically increases the inertia of the target, locking its movement in the direction it is currently moving. The effect of this spell depends on whether or not the target was moving when it was hit by the spell. If it was moving, it will continue hurtling nonstop in that direction against its will for 4 rounds. If it was standing in place, it will be immobilized for 4 rounds. A successful Saving Throw vs. Polymorph at -4 negates the effects of this spell.~
@34153=~Detect Shapeshifters
(Divination)

Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Entire area
Saving Throw: None

This spell lets the caster see if any creatures are shapeshifters in disguise. After the spell is cast, all shapeshifters in the current area will glow purple briefly. In addition, the caster will be informed of what kind of shapeshifter each one is. Detect Shapeshifters can detect several different kinds of shapeshifters, including ones that have assumed a different physical form, such as doppelgangers and lycanthropes, as well as ones that appear a different form through illusionary magic, such as rakshasas. The shapeshifters themselves do not automatically realize they have been detected, and the spell does not necessarily cause them to revert to their true form.~
@34154=~Summon Kobold
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 8 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons a kobold with no special abilities. The kobold remains a faithful servant of the wizard for 8 rounds, at which point it is unsummoned. The kobold summoned by this spell ignores the summoning limit.~
@34155=~Dimension Door
(Alteration)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell transports the caster to any place within the visual range of the caster. When the spell is cast, a dimensional portal opens up in front of the caster, who immediately steps through it. Upon passing through the portal, the caster finds <PRO_HIMHER>self at <PRO_HISHER> chosen destination.~
@34156=~Jump
(Alteration)

Level: 1
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows a creature to jump higher and farther. Until the duration ends, the creature gains an ability they can use at will, which lets the creature jump up to 10 feet away. The maximum jump distance is increased by 3 feet per 5 caster levels, to a maximum of 28 feet at level 30. The creature is able to jump over normally impassable obstacles like fences or walls, as long as they are narrow enough to jump over. At higher levels, the increased jump distance will allow the creature to jump over thicker obstacles. While in the air, the creature is unaffected by certain ground-based spells like Entangle, Web, and Earthquake.~
@34157=~Hex
(Enchantment)

Level: 1
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell curses the target to take more magical and elemental damage. The target must make a Save vs. Polymorph. On a failure, the target is cursed for 6 rounds. During that time, whenever the target would be dealt fire, cold, electricity, acid, or magic damage, it takes an additional 6 damage of that type. Hex is especially effective when combined with spells that deal damage multiple times, such as Magic Missile or Melf's Acid Arrow. Hex can also be cast by Invokers.~
@34251=~Power Word, Pull
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When the wizard speaks a Power Word of Pulling, <PRO_HESHE> magically pulls another creature to <PRO_HIMHER>self. For one round, the creature will be unable to move of its own will and will be pulled toward the wizard at great speed. During that round, if the wizard moves, the creature will be dragged along with <PRO_HIMHER>. There is no Saving Throw, though Magic Resistance can prevent the effects. The caster can cast Power Word, Pull on a creature even if <PRO_HESHE> cannot see the creature; however, the caster must be aware of the creature's existence and they must be on the same plane. Power Word, Pull is technically a summoning spell, as it summons the target of the spell.~
@34252=~Ghostwalk
(Alteration)

Level: 2
Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows a creature to float a short distance through a wall or across a gap. After the spell is cast on a creature, the next time that creature moves in a direction, it will instead ghostwalk in that direction. For 3 seconds, that creature will float in a straight line in that direction, passing through normally impassable obstacles. After 3 seconds, the effect ends; if the creature is in an impassable area at that time, it will instantly jump to the nearest inhabitable space.~
@34253=~Power Word, Push
(Abjuration)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When the wizard speaks a Power Word of Pushing, <PRO_HESHE> magically pushes another creature away from <PRO_HIMHER>self. For one round, the creature will be unable to move of its own will and will be pushed away from the wizard at great speed. There is no Saving Throw, though Magic Resistance can prevent the effects. The caster can cast Power Word, Push on a creature even if <PRO_HESHE> cannot see the creature; however, the caster must be aware of the creature's existence and they must be on the same plane.~
@34254=~Intoxicate
(Enchantment)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The target of this spell will instantly become dangerously drunk, far more than is pleasurable. The target gains four intoxication points for every Constitution point they have less than 25. For example, if the target has 10 Constitution, they will gain 60 intoxication points. Like normal drunkenness, this magical intoxication will wear off over time. A successful Save vs. Spell at -5 negates the effect. Intoxicate has no effect on undead or constructs. Multiple uses of this spell are cumulative.

Note: High levels of intoxication give luck penalties. The size of the penalty depends on the number of intoxication points:

0-49:   No penalty
50-60: -2 Luck
60-69: -4 Luck
70-79: -6 Luck
80-89: -8 Luck
90-99: -10 Luck
100:   -12 Luck~
@34255=~Null Healing
(Necromancy)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 day
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This necromantic curse prevents the target from healing. Once cast, the target must save vs. Spell at -8 or be cursed for 1 day. While cursed, the target cannot regain Hit Points via spells, abilities, items, regeneration, or resting. The curse can be removed early using a Remove Curse spell.~
@34256=~Specific Spell Immunity
(Abjuration)

Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: All allies
Saving Throw: None

Specific Spell Immunity lets the caster channel the power of their spells to shield the party from those same spells. The caster may choose up to three spells <PRO_HESHE> has memorized. Those spells are then consumed (expending one of each spell), giving allies immunity to each of those spells for 8 hours. The spell affects all allied creatures in the current area, including party members and summoned creatures.~
@34257=~Levitate
(Alteration)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell suspends a creature in midair. For the duration, the target is stuck in midair and cannot move unless it can fly. While levitating, it is almost impossible for the target to hit or be hit by other creatures with melee weapons. The target is also unaffected by ground-based spells such as Grease, Entangle, Web and Earthquake. If the target is an ally, there is no Saving Throw necessary; otherwise, the target may make a Save vs. Polymorph at -3 to avoid the effects.~
@34258=~Bounce Spell
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: 2 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This simple abjuration should be cast when the wizard sees another spellcaster in the midst of casting a spell at <PRO_HIMHER>. If the wizard would be hit by a spell within 2 rounds of casting, <PRO_HESHE> will be unaffected, and the incoming spell will be reflected back at its caster. Bounce Spell expires if it reflects a spell, or after 2 rounds have passed. Bounce Spell will not protect the caster from a Dispel Magic. However, it will not be affected by a Dispel Magic, either.~
@34351=~Absorb Spell
(Abjuration)

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 2 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This simple but powerful spell should be cast when the wizard sees another spellcaster in the midst of casting a spell at <PRO_HIMHER>. It blocks the first spell (of any level) that hits the caster within the next 2 rounds. If a spell is blocked this way, the wizard absorbs its power, regaining a previously cast spell whose level is less than or equal to the level of the spell absorbed. For example, if the wizard is hit by a Finger of Death (7th-level spell), <PRO_HESHE> gets seven spell levels back-<PRO_HESHE> will regain one spell up to 7th level in power.~
@34352=~Fly
(Alteration)

Level: 3
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This wondrous spell gives a creature the power to fly. For the duration, the creature can fly over normally impassable objects such as houses, walls, and rivers, but only as long as the creature is outdoors. The higher level the caster, the faster the creature's flying speed. The creature is also unaffected by ground-based spells such as Grease, Web, Entangle, and Earthquake.~
@34353=~Displacement
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

The spell Displacement shifts the apparent position of the caster, such that <PRO_HESHE> appears to be several feet away from where <PRO_HESHE> actually is. Attacks against the displaced caster have a 50% chance of missing. Any effect that dispels illusions can dispel Displacement.~
@34354=~Terror
(Necromancy)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This is the necromantic version of the second-level spell Horror. All creatures in the area of effect, friend or foe, must save vs. wands at -4 or run away in fear for 1 turn. Unlike the spell Horror, Terror actually physically harms targets' minds. Although this spell affects allies, this does not bother the necromancer, for <PRO_HISHER> allies are undead.~
@34355=~Control Slime
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to take control of a single slime creature for one turn. Since Control Slime is a particularly specialized spell, it is very effective: the slime gets no Saving Throw, and its Magic Resistance is no help. Control Slime has no effect on non-slimes.~
@34356=~Legend Lore
(Divination)

Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

A more powerful version of the spell Identify, Legend Lore temporarily increases the lore of the caster, allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to identify multiple magical items. For the duration, the caster's lore is increased by 100.~
@34357=~Glyph of Spell Storing
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: Permanent until discharged
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

A Glyph of Spell Storing is a ward which stores a spell and releases it upon each hostile creature that enters the warded area. When this spell is cast, the caster stores a single 1st-level spell in the glyph, which is placed on a circular, 9-ft. radius area of the caster's choice. When a hostile creature passes within 9 feet of the glyph, it explodes, releasing a copy of the stored spell on each hostile creature within 12 feet. A caster who is level 10 or higher may also store 2nd-level spells in the glyph.~
@34358=~Familiar Spell
(Conjuration)

Level: 3
Range: Familiar must be in the same area
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: The caster's familiar
Saving Throw: None

Familiar Spell imbues the caster's familiar with a spell. The caster chooses one of their 1st-level spells, consuming one use of that spell. For the next 8 hours, each time their familiar hits a creature with an attack, it instantly casts a copy of the chosen spell on the target. The spell is cast at the level of the familiar's owner, not at the level of the familiar. The familiar must be owned by the caster, and it must be in the same area as the caster when Familiar Spell is cast (and not in the caster's inventory).~
@34359=~Throw
(Alteration)

Level: 3
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell throws the target into the air with incredible force. The target is knocked back as it is sent hurtling through the air. When it lands or hits the ceiling, it takes crushing damage based on how fast it was moving right before the collision, up to 1d6 per caster level. If the target succeeds on a Save vs. Polymorph at -2, it is thrown with less force and will only take about half damage.~
@34451=~Wall of Fire
(Evocation)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 8 ft. long, 2 ft. wide wall
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a wall of raging flames. Any creature who attempts to pass through the wall takes 1d4 fire damage per caster level, up to a maximum of 12d4 at level 12. There is no Saving Throw, since the flames cannot be dodged except by going around the wall. A creature that has passed through a Wall of Fire cannot take damage from passing through a Wall of Fire again for 1 round.~
@34452=~Phantasmal Killer
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

One of the few offensive illusion spells, Phantasmal Killer causes the target to be struck down by an embodiment of its worst fears. If the target was panicking when it got hit by the spell, it must Save vs. Death at -4 or die instantly. If it makes the save or it wasn't panicking, it takes 8d6 magic damage. A Death Ward will prevent the instant death but not the damage. Phantasmal Killer has no effect on undead, constructs, or oozes. It can also be cast by Necromancers.~
@34453=~Ghoulish Feast
(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell lets the caster summon undead by killing other creatures. During the duration of this spell, whenever the caster kills a creature, a ghoul rises to feast upon the remains. That ghoul will serve the caster for 8 hours. A ghoul will only be summoned if the caster dealt the killing damage to the creature; if the caster damaged the creature but another party member finished it off, the caster will not get a ghoul.~
@34454=~Backstab Sequencer
(Illusion)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Backstab Sequencer essentially lets the caster backstab a creature with a spell. The caster is prompted to store a single spell of 2nd-level or lower. The next time the caster backstabs a creature, that spell is released on the creature. The released spell is cast on the creature a number of times equal to the caster's backstab multiplier. If the caster does not have a backstab multiplier, <PRO_HESHE> gains a x2 multipier until the spell is released.~
@34455=~Redirect Spell
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: 2 creatures
Saving Throw: None

Redirect Spell changes the target of a spell another creature is casting to a target of one's choice. In using this spell, the caster selects two creatures, one of whom must be casting a spell. That creature's spell is then altered to target the other selected creature. The redirected spell is cast instantly, preventing the creature from stopping the casting. If both creatures are casting spells, the second creature's spell will be altered to target the first creature. There is no Saving Throw.~
@34456=~Copy Spell
(Conjuration)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: 2 creatures
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the wizard to cast a copy of a spell another creature is casting. In using this spell, the caster selects two creatures, one of whom must be casting a spell. That spell is then replicated by the wizard, who casts the spell instantly on the other selected creature. If both creatures are casting spells, the second creature's spell will be copied, and the copy will target the first creature. There is no Saving Throw. Copy Spell can be used either to double an ally's spell or to turn an enemy's spells against them.~
@34457=~Linked Portals
(Conjuration)

Level: 4
Range: 10000 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius for each portal
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates two portals that creatures can teleport between. In casting this spell, the caster chooses two points anywhere in the current area. A portal is created at each location. Any creature that comes within 5 feet of a portal is sucked in and instantly appears at the other portal. That creature won't teleport back unless it leaves and re-enters the area of the portal. Creatures immune to pushing and pulling effects cannot use the portals. Up to five pairs of portals can be active in one area at a time.~
@34458=~Vampiric Link
(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Vampiric Link lets the caster absorb any life energy the target loses. For the duration, whenever the target creature takes damage, the caster regains that many Hit Points. The caster can cast Vampiric Link on allies or enemies, but not on <PRO_HIMHER>self. A single caster can establish Vampiric Links on multiple creatures, but no one creature can be affected by more than one Vampiric Link at once. Undead and constructs cannot be the target of this spell, but they can still cast it on other creatures.~
@34459=~Recall Party
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 3
Range: Infinite
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: All party members
Saving Throw: None

Recall Party teleports all party members to the caster's side. The range is unlimited, and party members can be drawn from a different area, so long as they are on the same plane as the caster.~
@34551=~Life Transfer
(Necromancy)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

A Life Transfer allows the caster to exchange <PRO_HISHER> life force with that of another creature, even if that creature is unwilling. If the target fails a Save vs. Polymorph at -4, its current HP is swapped with the caster's current HP. This exchange will not bring the caster above <PRO_HISHER> maximum HP total.~
@34552=~Steal Spells
(Alteration)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell steals memorized spells from the target and grants their spell slots to the caster. For every 3 caster levels, the target loses one memorized spell of the highest level possible. For each spell drained this way, the caster regains a previously-cast spell of a level less than or equal to the level of the stolen spell (though Steal Spells itself cannot be regained this way).

Range: 0
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Entire area

A lesser time manipulation spell, Freeze Inanimates stops time for all inanimate objects that are not being worn or carried by a creature.

Magical projectiles are also frozen immediately after being conjured. All creatures can still move and do actions while time is stopped.

Level: 7
Range: 10000 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Far Sequencer allows the wizard to cast a spell at a target beyond the wizard's visual range. When cast, this spell prompts the wizard to choose a single spell of any level. That spell is immediately released, targeting a creature or point up to 10000 feet away with the spell. The range of the spell will be extended to 10000 feet unless it normally has a range of touch, in which case it should not be used with Far Sequencer. The wizard can target a creature or point <PRO_HESHE> cannot see directly, as long as the target can be seen by an ally or by another divination spell.~

In addition, arcane spellcasters in the area of effect forget three memorized spells each round due to the amnesia caused by Stygian ice. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or fiends. The caster is immune to <PRO_HISHER> own spell, but <PRO_HISHER> allies are not.~
@34755=~Death Trigger
(Necromancy)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent until death
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Death Trigger lets the caster store a single spell inside multiple allied creatures, to be released when they die. The caster must first choose a single spell of 3rd-level or lower. That spell is then stored inside each ally within 15 feet of the target, including summoned creatures. Each of these creatures will instantly cast their copy of the spell when they die. Note that the spell is treated as cast by the dying creature and at that creature's caster level (1 by default). If Death Trigger were to be cast again, the new spell would replace the previous spell stored in each target.

When selecting a spell, the caster can also choose whether the dying ally will release the spell on itself, on its previous attacker, or on the nearest enemy (there is also a prompt to choose a condition for releasing the spell, but no matter what is chosen, the condition will be on death).~
@34756=~Critical Sequencer
(Enchantment)

Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent until triggered
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Critical Sequencer lets the caster cast spells through critical hits. The caster is prompted to store two spells of 3rd-level or lower, and the caster's weapons are temporarily imbued with those spells.

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Nearest corpse in 3-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell "resurrects" the target as an undead creature under the caster's control. Reanimate cannot target a dead creature directly; it should be cast targeting the location of a corpse. The nearest dead creature to the target point, excluding undead, constructs, most extraplanar creatures, and creatures higher level than the caster, will be reanimated. The reanimated creature becomes undead, but can still use its abilities and spells. It is controlled by the caster until destroyed.~

(Enchantment)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 7 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

"Extraordinary" is definitely an understatement of the sheer amount of good fortune this spell gives the recipient. It is almost possible to *see* the way reality is warped as it accommodates the newfound luck of the individual.

For 7 rounds, the target gains 1 point of luck, a +1 bonus to all saving throws, and a +5% bonus to all thieving skills for every level of the caster.~
@34851=~Enhance Attribute
(Alteration)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 4 hours
Casting Time: 8

Saving Throw: None

An Enhance Attribute spell can vastly improve a single attribute of a creature. In casting this spell, the caster first chooses whether <PRO_HESHE> wishes to enhance a creature's Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. Then <PRO_HESHE> points at a creature, or chooses <PRO_HIMHER>self. The spell sets the chosen attribute of the target creature to 24 for the duration, or until dispelled. The spell has no effect if the chosen attribute of the creature is already higher than 24.~

(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 18-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a large, immobile sphere of illusionary magic. Any creature that enters the sphere becomes invisible. A creature can only become invisible via Globe of Invisibility once per round, even if there are multiple globes, though they become invisible regardless of when in the round they enter the area of effect. An effect that dispels illusionary protections will not dispel the globe, though it will dispel the invisibility that creatures obtained from the globe.~

(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Otto's Irresistible Spin forces multiple creatures to spin in place against their will for 1 turn. Affected creatures will do nothing other than repeatedly spin in place, even if they see enemies. The spell is irresistible - there is no Saving Throw, and Magic Resistance will not block the spell. If an affected creature takes damage, the effects of the spell immediately end for that creature.~
@34854=~Recurring Contingency
(All)

Level: 8
Range: 0
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Recurring Contingency is like other Contingency spells, except that the stored spell is cast repeatedly. Upon casting Recurring Contingency, the caster is prompted to store a single spell of 2nd-level or lower, choose a target for the spell, and choose conditions under which the spell will be released. During the next hour, the spell will be cast on the target each round that the condition is met (or each time the caster is hit, if the caster chose it to trigger upon getting hit).~
@34855=~Omnipresence
(Alteration)

Level: 8
Range: Touch
Duration: 12 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The spell Omnipresence spreads the essence of the target creature throughout the area, allowing the creature to do actions at longer range than normal. For the duration or until dispelled, the creature can attack any creature in sight with any weapon, even with melee weapons. The creature can also target other creatures with touch spells at long range, and can cast spells at a target outside their visual range. However, these effects also go the other way. An omnipresent creature can be attacked with melee weapons and targeted by touch spells at long range. Since Omnipresence makes the creature's form less solid, the creature can move through other creatures while under the effects of the spell.~
@34856=~Contingency Curse
(Enchantment)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature

Contingency Curse forces a hostile creature to release spells against its will on the caster's terms. Upon casting Contingency Curse, the caster is prompted to store a single spell of 2nd-level or lower, choose a target for the spell, and choose conditions under which the spell will be released. The target of the spell is then cursed to cast that spell repeatedly under those conditions. For example, the caster could store a Web spell and make the creature cast Web on itself whenever it gets hit. Contingency Curse can only curse enemies.~

(Divination)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The spell Extend Vision allows the recipient to see much farther than <PRO_HESHE> could see before. The recipient will be able to see creatures that are too far away to return the gaze. More importantly, the recipient can target those creatures with spells and ranged attacks from far away. Extend Vision also makes the recipient immune to blindness. It lasts for 8 hours or until dispelled.~
@34858=~Sphere of Reversed Gravity
(Alteration)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 18-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a large spherical area that reverses the gravity of creatures inside it. Any creature that enters the area of effect will start falling up.

Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell bolsters a creature's life force through necromancy. For 8 hours, the target gains 10 temporary hit points per caster level.

@34860=~Enslave
(Enchantment)

Level: 8
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

An especially potent mind-control spell, Enslave will make the target a permanent thrall of the caster. If the target fails its Save vs. Spell at -4, it is dominated by the caster until the effect is dispelled. The enslaved creature will not take any actions unless ordered by the caster, and it will not turn hostile if hurt by a party member. Undead and constructs are unaffected by Enslave.~
@34861=~Polar Ray
(Evocation)

Level: 8
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 2 ft. by 30 ft. jet
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting Polar Ray, the caster emits a powerful beam of frost at the target. The target and all creatures between the caster and the target take 12d6 cold damage. The polar ray deals the same damage again half a round later to the target and anyone who is still in the ray's path.~
@34862=~Clone Other
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster

(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 9
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the ultimate form of invisibility. While under the effect of Perfect Invisibility, a creature can attack, cast a spell or otherwise interact with another creature or object while remaining completely invisible. However, Perfect Invisibility can still be dispelled by effects that would dispel regular invisibility, such as True Sight or Dispel Magic. Barring such removal, the spell will last for 3 rounds. Perfect Invisibility can only be cast by Illusionists.~
@34952=~Mass Domination
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 9
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 12 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 25-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

The Mass Domination spell enables the caster to control the actions of a group of creatures while the spell is in effect. This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victims. Unlike the 4th-level priest spell Mental Domination, the targets have no option for release, even if made to do something against their morals. This effect can only be reversed by Dispel Magic. The targets are allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty to negate the effect.~

(Necromancy)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 6 hours
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Perhaps the most powerful life-draining spell, Vampiric Feast allows the caster to absorb Hit Points from many victims at once. Every creature in a 15-foot radius takes 30 damage with no Saving Throw. For every creature dealt damage this way, the caster gains 30 temporary hit points. Hit points gained this way are cumulative; the caster can gain a massive amount of health by draining many creatures with Vampiric Feast. The bonus hit points last for six hours.~
@34955=~Mass Sequencer
(Invocation)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Mass Sequencer allows the caster to cast one of <PRO_HISHER> spells on many creatures simultaneously. When Mass Sequencer is cast, the caster is prompted to store a single spell of 3rd-level or lower. Once activated, the sequencer will cast copies of the stored spell on every creature in a 15-foot radius around the target. For example, if the caster stores a Fireball spell and then activates the sequencer on a 15' radius area containing four creatures, then four fireballs will be launched, each targeting a different creature.

At higher levels, the maximum spell level that can be stored in a Mass Sequencer increases:

Caster Level                   Maximum Spell Level
18 and below                   3
19-24                          4
25-30                          5

(Alteration)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This strange, fantastic spell hails from the Planes, where it was the byproduct of esoteric mathematical research by the modron mathemagician Enoll Eva. While Enoll Eva's Duplication is active, the caster's actions are multiplied by 2. The caster attacks twice as many times per round, and whenever <PRO_HESHE> casts a spell, <PRO_HESHE> immediately casts that spell an additional time, without using up a spell slot. Note that some spells do not stack and thus will not have double the effect when cast twice.~

Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius

(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 9

Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates an illusory adult red dragon, which will serve the caster for the duration. The illusory dragon has only 20% the hit points of a real dragon of the same age, and its attacks deal nonlethal damage, but its stats are otherwise the same as those of a real dragon, and it has the same abilities, including fire breath and an aura of fear.~
@34959=~Damage Turning
(Abjuration) 

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None 

Damage Turning reflects damage from the caster back to the attacker. While Damage Turning is active, any damage that would be dealt to the caster from an attack, spell or ability is prevented. The source is dealt the full damage they would have dealt the caster. Other effects of attacks, spells, and abilities are not reflected; just the damage. Damage Turning can only be cast by Abjurers.~

@35374=~Standing before you is a djinni of immense power, the air thick with electricity around it. It regards you coolly. "Greetings to you, spellweaver. Are you ready to begin negotiations?"~
@35375=~The djinni grins widely, winking at you. "Perhaps the wisest of courses, spellweaver. Very well... it shall be as you wish."~
@35376=~The being pauses a moment, surprised, before chuckling with amusement. "We are between moments here, spellcaster. Time has no bearing on you and me while we speak; have no worry."~
@35377=~"The spell you have cast is an attempt to temporarily control vast cosmic power. It is unstable and therefore only truly useful in combat events... unless you have years to devote to the formulation of your wish, of course."~
@35378=~"It is that formulation that requires negotiation." The djinni pulls a quill and a paper scroll from the air, grinning. "Since you do not have years to waste, you will attempt to describe to me what you desire from your wish."~
@35379=~"And I," here the djinni looks pleased, "will use my vast intelligence to distort your purpose as I please. Don't feel bad... the forces at work here are such that it is not often that one gets what one truly hopes for."~
@35380=~"But you can certainly try. The wise often do well... and you spellweavers are often quite wise, yes?" It taps its quill thoughtfully on its head. "Do you wish to begin, then?"~
@35381=~The djinni nods. "As you say." Quickly, the two of you begin negotiating a complex contract. The djinni is tricky, carefully attempting to twist your meaning with words, legal phrases, and clauses that you can barely understand...~
@35382=~Fortunately, you are quick to catch on. Before long, you begin tricking the djinni's phrasings yourself, leaving it quite frustrated. You still doubt you'll get what you want, but chances are the djinni won't be able to trick you.~
@35383=~You are wise enough to keep pace with the djinni, preventing the being from taking total advantage of you. Still... the contract is hard to understand, and you wonder at the end result.~
@35384=~Throughout the process, the djinni continues to baffle you... and you are not even sure if your desired wish will be similar to your original premise. At best, you stall the worst of the clauses.~
@35385=~Your lack of wisdom leaves you at a complete disadvantage. Throughout the writing of the contract, the djinni all but bullies you mentally into a position of watching him all but write the complex document on his own... there are few objections you can make.~
@35386=~The contract complete, the djinni dons a pair of spectacles and looks it over with an arched brow. "Very well, spellcaster. I can interpret the items listed here in the following ways. Choose carefully which you would prefer."~
@35387=~I am ready.~
@35388=~Negotiations? What do you mean?~
@35389=~I don't have time to negotiate in the middle of combat!~
@35390=~No, I have changed my mind. Return to whence you came.~
@35391=~Then explain to me what you meant by negotiations.~
@35392=~Then let us begin.~
@35393=~Never mind. Return to where you came from, djinni.~
@35394=~But we don't have time to do all this in the middle of combat!~

This spell instantly destroys a target, blasting it into small chunks.

This spell creates a staff of force in the caster's hand. It is treated as a magical weapon, doing 1d1+9 crushing damage per hit, and it can hit creatures that require +10 weapons to hit, though it has no bonus to hit. The Decastave uses the quarterstaff proficiency, though it gives the wielder proficiency in quarterstaves if <PRO_HESHE> is not already proficient.

Duration: 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell turns a target's blood to flame, doing 3d4 Hit Points of damage every round and driving the victim berserk with pain. The target gets to save vs. Spell at -4 every round; if successful, the damage and berserk state are negated. This spell does not work against undead or extraplanar creatures that do not have blood (such as elementals). If the creature is resistant to fire, this resistance will lower or nullify the damage from this spell.~

@44430=~Mordenkainen's Force Missiles
(Invocation)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 2-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a brilliant globe of magical energy that streaks forth from the caster's hand to unerringly strike its target, much like a Magic Missile spell. The wizard creates one missile at 7th level and an additional missile at every third level after 7th-in other words, two missiles at 10th level, three at 13th, four at 16th, and so on, to a maximum of seven missiles at 25th level. Each missile inflicts 2d4 points of damage to the target and then bursts in a 2-ft. radius concussive blast that inflicts 1 point of damage per level of the caster-for example, a 12th-level wizard could conjure two force missiles, each of which strikes for 2d4+12 points of magic damage. Creatures taking damage can attempt a Save vs. Spell to negate the concussion damage, but the impact of the missile itself allows no Saving Throw. The 1st-level wizard spell Shield will absorb the force missiles harmlessly, including the concussion damage.~
@44431=~Shout
(Invocation)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 17-ft. cone with 15-deg. arc
Saving Throw: Special

Shout grants the wizard tremendous vocal powers, allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to emit an earsplitting roar from <PRO_HISHER> mouth in a cone-shaped area of effect. Any creature within this area is deafened for 9 rounds and suffers 10d6 points of magic damage. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half. The targets are also knocked back, whether they make the save or not.~
@44432=~Vitriolic Sphere
(Conjuration)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell conjures a sphere of glowing emerald acid that the caster can direct to strike any target within range. When it reaches its target, the sphere explodes and drenches the victim in potent acid. The victim suffers 1d4 points of acid damage per caster level, to a maximum of 12d4 points of damage. After the initial damage, the victim must save vs. Spell to avoid more damage. If unsuccessful, the victim continues to suffer acid damage in the following rounds, sustaining two less dice of damage each round. For example, an 8th-level wizard inflicts 8d4 damage with this spell on the first round, 6d4 on the second round, 4d4 on the third round, 2d4 on the fourth round, and the spell ends on the fifth round. Each round after the first, the victim is entitled to a Save vs. Spell to avoid further damage.

The vitriolic sphere also splashes acid in a 5-ft. radius around the primary target. Any creatures within the splash radius must save vs. Petrification/Polymorph or suffer a splash hit that inflicts 1d4 points of damage per every five levels of the caster. Splash hits do not cause continuing damage.~
@44524=~Shroud of Flame
(Invocation)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/2 levels (special)
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes a creature to burst into flames, with no Saving Throw possible. The creature will burn for 2d6 points of fire damage every round, and gouts of flame erupt from the burning target, causing any creatures within 5 ft. to take 1d4 points of fire damage from the flames. Anyone hit by the victim's flames will contract the shroud themselves. The shroud of flame dissipates if the caster and target are no longer in the same area.~
@44610=~Antimagic Shell
(Abjuration)

Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell surrounds the caster with an invisible barrier that moves with <PRO_HIMHER>. This barrier makes the wizard immune to any magical attacks, but it prevents <PRO_HIMHER> from casting spells.

Antimagic Shell also dispels deafness and feeblemindedness in the caster.~
@44626=~Lich Touch
(Necromancy)

Level: 6
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Special

This spell confers the powers of a lich's touch and a lich's immunities upon the caster. The wizard gains immunity to paralysis and fear while the spell is in effect, and <PRO_HISHER> hands glow with an unearthly blue radiance. When the wizard attacks a creature with the lich's touch, that creature takes 1d2 fist damage (plus Strength bonus) and 3d10 magic cold damage, and the creature must Save vs. Paralysis at -2 or be paralyzed for 3 rounds. Undead and constructs only take the fist damage and are not paralyzed. The lich's touch can affect creatures that require +6 weapons in order to hit.~
@44631=~Soul Eater
(Necromancy)

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 7-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell deals 6d8 magic damage to all hostile living creatures within a 14-ft. radius. Any creatures that die as a result of this damage are obliterated, and their essence is transformed into a skeleton warrior under control of the caster. Also, for each creature that dies in this manner, the caster gains 10 temporary hit points for 8 hours. Soul Eater has no effect on undead, constructs, and elemental creatures.~
@44724=~Acid Storm
(Evocation)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell unleashes an acidic downpour on the area of effect, doing 1d4 points of acid damage each round for the first three rounds, 1d6 points for the next three rounds, and 1d8 points for each round thereafter. Moving out of the area of effect does not stop the damage-the acid adheres to the skin, and any creatures in the area of effect when Acid Storm is cast continue to suffer acid damage as long as the spell duration lasts. Creatures make a Save vs. Spell every round after they have been hit by the cloud-if successful, they only take half damage (for that round only).~
@44726=~Suffocate
(Necromancy)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 7-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell draws the breath out of all creatures within the area of effect. Creatures that do not breathe are unaffected. Suffocating creatures suffer -4 to Armor Class, -4 to hit, -6 to Dexterity, one less attack per round, half movement rate, and take 4d8 points of magic damage per round. A successful Save vs. Breath at -4 negates all effects but 2d8 points of damage for one round. The effects begin to fade when the creature moves out of the area of effect, although it can take a round for a character to catch their second wind.~
@44814=~Iron Body
(Alteration)

Level: 8
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell transforms the caster's body into living iron, granting <PRO_HIMHER> several powerful resistances and abilities. While the spell is in effect, the caster is 100% resistant to fire and poison, and 25% resistant to all physical damage. Spells that affect respiration or the physiology of the caster, such as Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting, Flaying, or Drown, are ignored. In addition, the caster's Strength is raised to 25.

Unfortunately, the caster's movement becomes slow and awkward, setting <PRO_HISHER> movement rate to 25% of <PRO_HISHER> normal.~
